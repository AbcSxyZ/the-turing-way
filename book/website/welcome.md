**{ref}`About the project<fw>`** üì¢
^^^

_The Turing Way_ is:

* a handbook,
* a community,
* a global collaboration

Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers and data scientists in academia, industry and the public sector need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.

Please learn more about the project in the {ref}`fw` section.

## Using _The Turing Way_

_The Turing Way_ is dedicated to making collaborative, reusable and transparent research ‚Äútoo easy not to do‚Äù.
This means bringing together people with diverse perspectives, socio-technical skills and lived experiences to build something more significant than any individual could deliver alone.
Everything here is available for free under a [CC-BY licence](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
Please use and re-use whatever you need, for any purpose.
We hope you find the content in the book helpful.
