## Motivation and Background

Every person should have the opportunity to participate fully and equally in all events and social activities â€“ regardless of their individual ability, gender, age, ethnic or social background and there has been an increased effort in many disciplines to involve members of the public and people with lived experience in research projects. 

This chapter is meant to serve as a resource to support and guide reseacrhers, organizers, and community members with the tools to identify the challenges and opportunities in organizing events that involve and include people with lived experience.

We refer to "people with lived experience" throughout this chapter as a way to recognize and acknowledge individuals who have direct personal knowledge, or firsthand experience of a particular situation, condition, or topic. It is a term often used to emphasise the importance of including the perspectives and insights of those who have had direct experience of a specific condition or situation. In the context of event planning, the considerations need to cover both the disability requirements of your attendees, and an identification of barriers that would be experienced by your specific attendees with lived experience. For example, attendees who are immunocompromised, experience long-term health conditions, people with disabilities, and those with caring resposibilities would all be considered as people with lived experience, and would have slightly different accomodations needed to support their engagement in an event. 

Because both internal resources and the events you run can range in size - from small meetings to massive multi-day conferences - this chapter is not an exhaustive list and instead is meant to provide general guidance about how to design events that are inclusive for people with lived experience. 

Please review and adapt the suggestions made by this chapter to align your event with the needs of your specific community and attendees.
