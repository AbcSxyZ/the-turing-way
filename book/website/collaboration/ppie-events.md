## Motivation and Background
This chapter is meant to serve as a resource to support and guide researchers, organisers, and community members with the tools to identify the challenges and opportunities in organising events that involve and include members of the public, and in particular people with lived experience.

We refer to "people with lived experience" throughout this chapter as a way to recognize and acknowledge individuals who have direct personal knowledge, or firsthand experience of a particular situation that is relevant to the topic of a research-related event. 
For example, this could relate to a particular medical condition, disability, or other social conditions. 
It is a term often used to emphasise the importance of including the perspectives and insights of those who have had direct experience. {cite:ps}nihr2021differentexperiences,camden2022preferredlanguage

This chapter is focused in particular on how to make research events more inclusive and accessible to members of the public and people with lived experience who do not have experience or a background as a researcher, as they can face particular barriers to participation.

Many research projects are increasingly involving members of the public in the research. 
Within the realm of biomedical and care-related research, this is often referred to as "Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement" or "PPIE" which has a goal to actively involve people with the lived experience of a specific disability, situation, health condition, or experience in the research process. {cite:ps}HDRUK2023ppie 
PPIE is done to ensure that research is aligned with the needs of those affected by it, and can also improve the quality of research by including lived perspectives. 
As part of this involvement and engagement, researchers and research staff will need to plan events that are inclusive and accessible for people with lived experience, and delivered in a way that supports people with lived experience taking part equitably.

"Lived experience" can be a range of things such as a disability, long-term health condition, bereavement, having worked in a specific profession, or the lived experience of caring responsibilities. 
In the context of event planning, any of these people with lived experiences might have slightly different accommodation needs to support their engagement at your event. 
Thus, your considerations need to cover both the potential disability requirements of your attendees as well as the specific barriers that would be experienced by your attendees with lived experience. 

This chapter focuses on the latter aspects, specific to involving people with lived experiences, for the more general and equally important considerations around accessibility â€“ that affect participants regardless of whether they are members of the public or not, please refer to specific accessibility resources.

Because both internal resources and the events you run can range in size - from small meetings to massive multi-day conferences - this chapter is not an exhaustive list and instead is meant to provide general guidance. 
It offers a starting point to adapt the suggestions made by this chapter to align your event with the needs of your specific community and attendees.
