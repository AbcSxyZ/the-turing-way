Around the logo is a thick oval with different colour bands, each with an image. Thes include a heart, a tree, a car, a spanner, a lightning bolt, a paint palete and a graph. Around the edge of the circle are lots of colourful stick figures interacting with each other in groups. Some appear to be talking, some shaking hands...

## Introduction to the Turing Way Practitioner's Hub 

The Turing Way Practitioners Hub is a Turing Way project that engages and involves industry experts, called Experts in Residence (EiRs), from partnering organisations. This initiative aims to advance their efforts in promoting best practices in data science and AI. The Practitioners Hub serves as a platform for cross-sector collaboration, knowledge exchange, and strategic partnerships, spanning various sectors and data science initiatives, including but not limited to the small and medium-sized (SMEs) enterprises in BridgeAI network. It is a useful example of academia-industry collaboration which could be recreated in other contexts. 
 
By leveraging a cohort-based approach, we build a shared understanding of open source principles, open data practices, cross-sector collaboration, research reproducibility, and ethical considerations in the context of data science and AI. EiRs are supported to develop case studies with stakeholders in their networks, sharing insights into the successes and challenges associated with the adoption of AI within their respective sectors. This is combined with customised training, expert consultation and collaborative opportunities, contributing to the improvement and adoption of data science practices that enhance the quality, viability, and real-world impact of data science and AI technologies in their sectors.

EiRs attended a series of day-long workshops (4 times over the 6 month programme), hosted by the Alan Turing Institute. The Turing Way Collaboration Cafe events were leveraged as opportunities to meet and discuss specific topics. Regular training events were held on Zoom/Teams, on a weekly/bi-weekly basis. 

This work is supported by Innovate UK BridgeAI. The Practitioners Hub has also received funding and support from the Ecosystem Leadership Award under the EPSRC Grant EP/X03870X/1 and The Alan Turing Institute.

## Case-studies 

In 2023, The Turing Way team partnered with five organisations as part of the inaurgural cohort of this programme, running over 6 months. The organisations invovled were: 
- British Antarctic Survey
- Genomics England
- Office of National Statistics
- Energy Systems Catapult
- Digihaul

During the course of the 2023 programme the Turing Way team co-created impact-based case studies about best practice open source science and AI adoption with each of the EiRs, with the help of scientific writer Stuart Gillespie. A meta case study was also produced to bring together learnings about organisational adoption of open and and responsible AI from each participating organisation ((https://zenodo.org/records/10777730)). Explore these case studies and other materials from the first cohort here: https://zenodo.org/communities/the-turing-way-practitioners.

## What went well 

1. The programme of activities was diverse, stimulating collaboration in different ways. It included but was not limited to: training around open-source concepts and frameworks, co-hosting a fireside chat, and building impact-based case studies.  

2. Different organisations had different levels of familiarity with open-source and best practices going into the programme. A kick-off workshop helped to 'level the playing field'. This was attended not only by the EiRs but other stakeholders and members of the BridgeAI network. During the workshop there were breakout discussions, talks from speakers and a panel discussion. 

## Challenges and lessons learned 

1. 'Downtime' is useful - The most productive conversations had amongst the EIRs often happened in the spaces between structured activities. As the programme went on, incorporating time allocated for unstructured discussion

2. A challenge during the programme was for EiRs and trainers to be mindful of different levels of resource availability within the different organisations.
