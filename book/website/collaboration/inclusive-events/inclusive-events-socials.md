# Inclusive Social and Networking Events
Social events, dinners, and even standing in the lines for coffee can be some of the best times for attendees to get to know one another, identify potential collaborators, and spark ideas.

As an organizer, you should consider how to make these serendipitous opportunities for networking and socializing as accessible as possible for people with lived experience who are attending your event.

Depending on the size and format of your event, this may look like structured networking sessions, a social dinner, or a 15 minute social break at the start or middle of your event. 

Please consider some of the suggestions below, and ensure that you take the time to consider and address any barriers that your specific attendees may face in joining social settings.

(cl-inclusive-events-social-events-timing)=
## Choosing a Time for Networking 
Ideally, at least one networking or social event will take place during the main event's program. 

Social and networking sessions are key elements of conferences and other knowledge-sharing events. 
Social events provide attendees with opportunities to share ideas, connect with potential collaborators, and build partnerships between attendees at different institutions.
They can be valuable spaces for researchers to follow up with a speaker or person with lived experience who engaged in discussions at the event.

However, networking sessions often take place at the end of the day which can lead to the exclusion of attendees who may have caring responsibilities or who may have a lived condition that causes fatigue meaning a full day of active engagement leaves them too tired to take part in social events. 

Consider hosting a social breakfast or networking session before lunch for all attendees. 
This can provide an opportunity for people to meet one another and join discussions before the formal start of your event. 

In-person networking events hosted before sit-down lunches can also help people with anxiety who may feel uncomfortable and unsure of where to sit and eat lunch. 
Hosting a social session before sit-down lunches can help these attendees connect with other people and identify who to sit with during the meal. 

(cl-inclusive-events-beverages)=
## Beverage Selection
If your event provides beverages, ensure that not all social gatherings are alcohol or bar-centred. 

Offer alcohol-free alternatives if your event hosts a drinks reception, and caffeine-free free options for attendees during refreshment breaks.

(cl-inclusive-events-social-events-accessibility)=
## Accessibility Requirements
Social events and networking should also have accessibility features like captioning or sign language interpretation, and include activities that do not restrict participation based on body type or ability.

For this reason, try to avoid "speed networking" where attendees have only 3-5 minutes to engage in conversation. 

For in-person events, this can be prohibitive for many people such as those with mobility impairments, people who require Sign Language interpreters or other Translators, and people with verbal processing differences. 
These same barriers affect people attending online events, as well as further negatively impacting those with low-bandwidth or internet connectivity issues. 

(cl-inclusive-events-name-tags)=
## Identification and Name Tags
If your event includes name tags or badges, ensure that you ask attendees for their preferred name, and display the name they provide. 

Consider including pronouns on attendees' badges to support attendees being gendered appropriately. 

You may also want to consider using lanyards to display name tags or badges. 
Many clip-on name tags assume that people have a pocket on the front of their shirts or jackets. 
However, many blouses, dresses, or shirts designed for women do not provide these pockets and therefore will not be able to easily display the name badge. 

Clip-on badges can also be difficult for people with fine motor disabilities or an impairment that would restrict their ability to pin the clip onto their shirts. 

(cl-inclusive-events-coloured-badges)=
### Traffic Light Badges
You may consider offering a "traffic light" coloured badge or name tag system that is available during social sessions or networking events. 
Traffic Light Systems can be a useful tool to set intent and expectations between attendees during social activities to make it clear which attendees are open to networking, and which would prefer to not engage in conversation. 

This can ensure that attendees who wish to not network are not surprised and forced to engage socially at your event, and that people who actively want to engage in conversation can easily identify others who also wish to actively network. 

This traffic light system was used by [LeadDev](https://leaddev.com/), a UK-based event organizer for their annual conference. 
> Red lanyards meant the attendee wished to be left alone during networking or social sessions. 
Any attendees wearing a red sticker could be confident that no one would try to engage them in conversation, and were therefore able to relax and engage in their own activities during social sessions. 

> Yellow indicated that the attendee was willing to talk to familiar people or to be introduced to others. 
Yellow was to signify that they were wanting to network and meet new collaborators at the event, but may feel uncomfortable initiating conversation themselves.

> Finally, green lanyards meant that the wearer would like to meet new people, and would be happy for people they didn't know to approach them and initiate conversation.

## Providing Guidance and Sparking Conversation 
Depending on the audience for your event, you may want to consider creating and sharing guidelines or suggestions on how to make the most of networking sessions. 
This can be especially helpful for autistic attendees, or attendees with social anxiety. 

Additionally, researchers and professionals who share a niche field may know one another from previous events or collaborative projects and may find it easier to identify friends or people they wish to speak to during networking events. 
Conversely, attendees with lived experience may not have had the opportunity to establish long-standing connections with several researchers and therefore may feel daunted by having to network at your event. 

Consider how to support your attendees from all backgrounds networking. 
You may consider providing question prompts or designing your networking and social spaces so that people can move between conversations easily. 

Providing a guide acknowledges the diverse needs of all attendees and promotes inclusivity by recognizing that everyone has unique challenges that may make social activities and networking more difficult.

We have curated a few topics or themes you may want to consider including in any guidance you provide. 

(cl-inclusive-events-networking-formats)=
### Information about the format
It can be helpful for many people with a lived experience of social anxiety (or other conditions) to have a structured format for social events.

For example, consider deciding on and including a title, goal, and suggested question prompts in the session description. 
This can provide a shared understanding among attendees of what is expected during any social session at your event. 

Although most social events are traditionally unstructured to allow for emergent discussion and knowledge sharing, it can be beneficial to provide guidance or prompts to start any social sessions and then allow for unstructured conversation time later in the session.

(cl-inclusive-events-networking-expectations)=
### Setting Expectations
In addition to information about the format that your social or networking event will have, consider including clear and explicit instructions about what engagement would be suitable and appropriate for your social activities, alongside examples that explain common social cues such as turning to face the person speaking and asking topical questions based on conversation. 

Social norms and expectations can be confusing for many people, especially autistic individuals who may be attending your event. 
A guide outlining the activities involved in any social or networking sessions can aid in explaining, and helping attendees understand what will be considered appropriate behaviour in different social situations. 

For example, poster sessions at research events are often considered to involve short interactions between a researcher and a group of people. 
At a poster session, an early career researcher may have the opportunity to share and explain their research project. 
These sessions would not be the best forum for public discourse about an attendee's lived experience or for criticizing the purpose of work that is being presented.
Instead, poster sessions may be useful to make introductions with other attendees who are interested in a particular topic, and are an opportunity to learn about the research that has been conducted by asking questions about the research that person is presenting on their poster.

Depending on the audience, your guide may need to be more or less detailed.
By providing guidance on the type of sessions, and what is expected in each setting, you can help facilitate more constructive and collaborative interactions between attendees, and reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings.

(cl-inclusive-events-conversation-prompts)=
### Sparking conversation between attendees 
Social skills are fundamental in building relationships, sharing ideas, and collaborating on research endeavours.

Providing guidance on how to start conversations and socialize effectively can help support attendees with lived experience in developing professional connections and meaningfully engage in your event.

Depending on the size and timings of your event, you can consider setting prompts such as "find a fellow attendee who has the same favourite movie as you", or "introduce yourself to 5 people you have never met before, and find 1 thing you have in common". 
Prompts such as these can provide attendees with a goal for the session and help attendees to start conversations with one another. 

Good conversation prompts or ice breaker questions are both interesting for someone to think about and answer themselves, and also make attendees curious to hear everyone else’s answer.

Knowing how to start a conversation and navigate social interactions can help boost attendees' confidence and support them in actively engaging in any social or networking activities.

(cl-inclusive-events-introduction-guide)=
#### How to introduce yourself 
You may consider providing examples of how to introduce yourself and start conversations. 
Pop-culture references providing good examples of how to introduce yourself can be found in the 1987 movie [The Princess Bride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_(film)) featuring a character called Inigo Montoya, or Pixar animation's movie [Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)) featuring a character named Russell.
These characters make excellent introductions by following a helpful and informative format:
- they state their name,
- say what their background or goal is,
- and then explain  what someone can expect from an interaction with them. 

For example: 
> "Hi, I'm The Turing Way. I'm an online handbook to help people learn and do reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science.
> I'm looking for collaborators on my guide to hosting inclusive events, do you have suggestions?"

Consider modelling the introduction format you would like attendees to use anytime you introduce yourself as organizers of the event, as well as asking any of the session moderators or facilitators to follow a recognizable format.

It can also be helpful to share a list of attendees (if this information is able to be shared) in an information booklet or alongside the event schedule. 
This can help attendees identify people whom they would like to connect with or speak to during any social activities or networking, before the start of your event. 

You may also want to consider asking attendees to add a name pronunciation guide during registration that you can place alongside the attendee list. 

(cl-inclusive-events-networking-conclusion)=
## Conclusion
Social events can often be uncomfortable and daunting for many people for a variety of reasons.

By providing a guide and establishing a structured approach to any social activities you will be able to reduce any potential anxieties that attendees may have and support all attendees being comfortable in fully engaging with your event.
