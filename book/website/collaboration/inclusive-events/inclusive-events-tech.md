# Technology Considerations for Inclusive Events
When planning an event that will be attended by people with lived experience, event organizers should carefully consider various technology aspects to ensure inclusivity, accessibility, and a seamless experience for all participants. 

This section focuses on considerations and recommendations around using different technologies to support the inclusion of people with lived experience at both in-person, hybrid or online events. 

(cl-inclusive-events-hybrid)=
## Hybrid as an Accessibility and Inclusion Strategy
Hybrid events, by default, prioritize accessibility and the inclusivity of attendees with lived experience, making them the ideal choice to engage an audience of individuals with diverse lived experiences. 
Online sessions can be better suited to individuals who experience extreme fatigue or find it difficult to attend in-person events. 
While in-person events can make use of local resources to support engagement and may be preferred by others requiring support.

The integration of both in-person and virtual components ensures that participants can engage in a manner that suits their preferences and circumstances.

The flexibility of hybrid formats recognizes the challenges faced by individuals with varied abilities and mobility constraints. 
Providing a virtual option can overcome any physical barriers presented by in-person only events. 
This flexibility also accommodates the diverse schedules and responsibilities of all attendees, and acknowledges any additional scheduling challenges that may be faced by people with lived experiences. 

Although planning and hosting hybrid events often requires more resources to be successful, by making your event hybrid you can better prioritize accessibility needs and the inclusion of attendees with lived experience at your event. 
This empowers is a wide range of participants to contribute and benefit from your event's content and community.

If you are planning a hybrid event, please review The Turing Way's {ref}`cl-hybrid-collab` and specifically the {ref}`cl-hybrid-collab-guidelines`.

## Using Email Reminders and Calendar Invitations
Many people with lived experience have to maintain a very busy schedule and often rely on online calendar tools and email reminders to stay organized. 

Consider sending both a Calendar placeholder invitation for your event, and email reminders the week before, the week of, and the morning of your event. 
This can help remind your attendees of their registration and help put the important information about your event at the top of their email inbox.

It can also be helpful to utilize the subject line of your email with important information. 
Consider including the Date and title of your event, in both the Calendar invitation and any email reminders that you send. 

```{note}
The Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement community for Multiple Long-Term Conditions has highlighted the importance of sending out reminder emails the week of the event, and the morning of the event. 

This was because medical appointments had often been scheduled after an event's "Save the Date" had been sent and many community members valued the reminders. 
```

Ensure that any email address you send invitations from is able to contact your attendees (and not flagged as a spam email account). 
You may suggest that attendees add your event's core email address to a list of trusted senders, or you can also ask for feedback from attendees leading up to an event which allows you to identify if your emails have been recieved. 

### Reaching attendees without email access
Your event may engage communities and people with lived experience who have barriers to accessing email or the internet regularly. 

Consider how you will keep in contact with these individuals, and what additional resources and safeguarding your organizers and staff members may need. 
For example, if attendees cannot access email, what other communication channels can be used. 
If you are able to send out information and keep in regular contact with the community through the telephone, social media, or a group chat, consider devoting resources towards a "work phone" for organizers so that they do not need to give out their personal phone number to attendees.

If this is the case for your event, it will be very important to source solutions from, and work alongside the community with that specific lived experience when planning your event.

## Zoom and Video Conferencing Etiquette
When choosing an online platform for your event, consider what tools are used by your attendees and ensure that the tools chosen are accessible to your attendees.

Zoom has been voted by disabled groups as the most accessible online video platform (you can read more about Zoom's accessibility features on the [Zoom website](https://www.zoom.com/en/accessibility/)).

It is very important to check with your specific attendees to inform your choice of platform. 
There can often be additional barriers to accessing software platforms for international attendees which should be taken into consideration when planning for any online content that is part of your event.

(cl-inclusive-events-tips-for-online-events)=
### Tips for hosting Inclusive Online Sessions 
#### Blurring Video Backgrounds
Encourage speakers and attendees who are engaging online to blur their background and to limit background noise as much as possible. 
This can help people with lived experience of sensory processing differences or hearing impairments engage in the session content, and can also minimize any unconscious bias that attendees or facilitators may have that can affect participation {cite:ps}`Cook2023zoom`. 

#### Offering various engagement pathways
If your event involves discussion or the active participation of attendees, consider offering support for both spoken and written engagement. 
For example, you can ask attendees if they would prefer to take part in the discussion in a speaking breakout room or a writing-only breakout room.
Offering different options recognizes the unique needs of individuals with varying lived experiences such as sensory and hearing impairments, speech and language disorders or other conditions which affect their ability to speak, as well as any attendees who may not speak the native language and may prefer to provide written responses.
 
#### Avoiding the use of Screen Sharing
Content that is shared using the "Screen Sharing" feature is not able to be accessed or parsed by screen reader technology.

If an attendee or presenter wishes to share their screen on a video conferencing platform, please ensure that the content they are sharing has been sent to participants before the start of the event and that speakers or presenters acknowledge this, and then take the time to explain what is being presented on screen to allow for any attendees to follow along with their own copies of the material.

### Communication during a Technical Outage
If your event requires the use of video conferencing tools, consider what technical issues both you and your attendees may have when accessing an online platform.

Consider what you will do and how you will communicate with attendees if power or internet access is lost for either yourself, your facilitators, or your attendees. 
For example, you may develop a document that can be accessed without the internet that contains important information and is sent to attendees before the start of the event. 

It will be important to share and highlight any information to attendees about what to expect during a technical incident. 

It may be helpful to assign multiple hosts for your online sessions. This will allow the session to continue in the event that one host experiences a technical outage.

```{tip}
For in-person events, consider packing spare adaptors cables and chargers for different types of laptops and devices. 

This can be helpful if a speaker needs one or if one breaks during your event. 
```

## Personnel and Staffing Planning
When planning your event, ensure that there is appropriate support for participation. 
Depending on your event, you may need to consider providing support for session facilitation, notetaking, and technical support. 
The tasks each role will be responsible for will differ depending on whether your event is solely in-person, hybrid, or hosted online. 

We have curated a few examples based on different event formats that can be used as guidance for planning your event. 

### In-Person Event
#### In-Person Technical Support 
* Ensuring that the audio and visual set-up is working.
* Supporting presenters and speakers with presentation set-up and slide transitions.
* Ensuring that any audio or hearing induction loop technology is working and accessible.
* Opening up polls or other interaction software used during the event.
#### In-Person Facilitator 
* Ensuring that attendees and any speakers are able to engage in the session.
* Working with a speaker or panellists to answer questions from the audience.
* Ensuring that questions taken from the audience represent the diversity of the attendees.
* Providing the audience with information about any emergency exits or other physical locations of importance during the event.
#### In-Person Notetaker 
* Taking notes during the session and capturing the main points of discussion. 
* Depending on your event, this may also involve sending notes or making them available to attendees with sensory impairments in order to support them engaging in the session.

### Hybrid and Online Event 
#### Technical Support 
* Supporting attendees and facilitators with sound or video focus difficulties.
* Hosting the online platform and opening the session if there is a waiting room.
* Placing attendees on mute if there is loud or distracting background noise. 

#### Online Facilitator
* Supporting the engagement of attendees and moderating conversation.
* Providing discussion prompts and asking thought-provoking questions.
* Introducing speakers and presenters.
* Facilitating Q&A and any polls that are used during the session.

#### Online Notetaker 
* Taking notes during the event's sessions and ensuring that they are accessible to all attendees.
* Summarizing information shared by online participants so that it may be communicated to and shared with in-person attendees

## Technology Guides
Even if the technology used during your event may be considered common or ubiquitous, it is important to recognize that all attendees will have had a different level of experience and exposure to technology. 

While many people with lived experience may be experts in the latest technology, this may not be the case for all attendees. 

Consider developing and providing tutorials and guides for each different technology tool that your attendees will interact with at your event. 
This is important for both in-person and especially so for online or hybrid events. 

This includes guides for technology such as Zoom, Slido, Slack, and any interactive software such as Miro or Microsoft Whiteboards. 
Before completing your guide, check if the tool or platform provides any documentation or tutorial material as part of their onboarding. 
Documentation provided by the developer can often highlight any accessibility features specific to that tool as well as being written for a general audience with no previous experience with the tool.

Ensure that these guides are written in an Easy-Read format and clearly explain both how to access, and how to use any of the technology required to engage at your event.

These guides should be provided before your event starts to allow attendees to familiarize themselves with the technology and troubleshoot any barriers or issues ahead of time. 

Although you may not be able to individually check with each attendee, providing guides and allocating time during your event for participants to learn and familiarize themselves with the tool can help to ensure that all attendees are comfortable using the platforms and tools of your event. 

```{tip}
You may want to consider how you will ensure that all participants are able to access any tools or platforms.

For example, by including an icebreaker or introductory activity that is completed by attendees. 
```

## Audio and Visual Considerations for In-Person Events 
In addition to what has been discussed above, there are unique technology challenges that in-person events face when running an inclusive event. 

The Audio and Visual set-up (sometimes referred to as "AV" or "A/V") will have a massive impact on how accessible and comfortable the content of your event is for people with lived experience, especially those with sensory impairments or differences. 

For example, large atriums or halls often do not have sound dampening and cause noise to echo and reverberate across the room. 
This can make it incredibly difficult for attendees with hearing impairments or sensory processing differences to listen and engage with your event's session content, and affects both in-person and online presenters. 

Carefully consider how far away your sound system and microphone are from attendees, and how clear the audio is for someone sitting or standing at different places in the room. 

You may want to work together with your organizing team to practice different sessions and check for audio clarity. 
Consider asking your team and co-organizers to sit or stand in various places around a room (or join online) and then adjust the sound level and placement of any microphones that will be used.

For hybrid events, you should also consider how loud and clear online speakers or attendees will be when speaking to in-person attendees. 
> For example, a recent hybrid conference had to reduce the sound level for the in-person facilitator's microphone in order to be comfortable for attendees in the room. 
> This made it difficult for online participants to hear the facilitator's instructions during the session. 
> To combat this happening at your event, complete audio checks for both in-person and online attendees before the event starts and ensure that both online and in-person attendees are able to clearly hear what is being said or presented. 

```{note}
For many people who use hearing aids, background noise causes 

Some hearing aids can also cause interference with older audio equipment resulting in shrill noises or "audio feedback" being heard. 
This can be quite painful for many people to experience so it is important to check the compatibility of your devices and to arrange your event location in a way that minimizes the risk of audio issues.
```

In addition to the audio, ensure that your content and planning take into account the availability of screens and where they are located in the room. 
This is especially important for in-person events that plan on using large venues or larger rooms.
Screens and displayed content can be an important accessibility feature for attendees with sensory impairments who may rely on closed captions, sign language interpreters, or a zoomed-in view of any presented content due to visual impairments.

Finally, for in-person or hybrid events, ensure that the sound system at your venue has an audio induction loop system that can send signals directly to hearing aids. 
The availability of this system should be posted on a sign at the entrance to the room, along with specifications if only a certain part of the room is covered. 
Consider additionally highlighting on your program or agenda what rooms and sessions at your event have support for audio induction loops, and who to contact to get access. 

(cl-inclusive-events-technology-final-checks)=
## What to check the day of the event
As part of hosting, is it important to make time before the event starts to ensure that the technology supports you planned for are working and able to be implemented. 

For example:
* Check that any slides or presentations that will be shown during your event are legible and able to be displayed on your equipment. 
* Check that any closed captioning software that you are using is functional and that the transcripts are able to be displayed and accessed by attendees.
* Run through any slide or presentation changes to check that any video or slide transitions do not display bright flashes which present a health risk and can trigger photosensitive epilepsy
* Check that audio induction loops are working and accessible to any attendees who need them.
* Test the internet, cameras or recording equipment, and lighting. 
* Ensure that wifi and cellular networks are accessible throughout the venue for any attendees who may need to check in with carers or other support staff who are not present at your event. 
* Ensure that there is clear guidance that is readily accessible to attendees in the event of a technical issue. 


Because this is not an exhaustive list, it is important to understand the needs and preferences of your specific attendees as part of making your event inclusive and accessible. 

Where possible, involve a representative with lived experience in your event planning and work with a community to ensure that any barriers introduced by technology use at your event can be addressed and mitigated. 

This can help your event create an inclusive and accessible environment, and ensure that individuals with lived experiences are able to fully participate and engage with your event.
