# Planning an Inclusive Event

Running an event that is inclusive of all is more than just a choice; it’s a necessity to ensure that all your participants will be able to fully engage in the event. 
Inclusion is more than a buzzword - it’s a commitment to ensuring that every individual regardless of their background, abilities, or current circumstances has equal opportunity to participate and thrive. 

For many projects, the involvement of individuals and communities with first-hand lived experience is critical to upholding and ensuring that the processes and outcomes developed are effective, inclusive, and equitable. 
This can involve hosting different events that are attended by people with lived experience and other members of the public, as well as researchers, clinical staff, and other professionals. 

This section provides guidance and considerations for how to design and host an inclusive event for a diverse audience of people with lived experience. 

The recommendations are not an exhaustive list, and it is always preferable to include a specific representative or person with lived experience in the event planning to ensure that your event is tailored to the needs of your specific attendees. 
Their inclusion in decision-making processes is essential to achieving an accessible and inclusive event.


## Accessibility vs. Inclusion: What to focus on

When designing and organising an event, it can be easy to focus on the accessibility requirements of the venue and overlook the steps needed to make an event inclusive and enjoyable for all participants. 

We can think of this in terms of “Universal Design” which is about designing an event or environment so that it can be accessed, understood, and used by all people regardless of their background, age, size, ability or disability. 

This is different from “Accessible Design” which focuses on designing around specific accessibility requirements. 

Developing an event for a specific community, or to include a specific group of people with lived experience can put a larger emphasis on specific accessibility features that would be needed to run an inclusive event 
(for example, ensuring materials in braille are provided and using high contrast colours in any visual material for attendees with visual impairments).

In order to organise an event for people with lived experience, accessibility requirements of your specific attendees should be identified early and accounted for throughout each stage, 
and your event should consider using universal design guidelines to ensure your event is as inclusive as possible. 

Organising an inclusive event is more than a legal requirement, it is about creating a more equitable, welcoming, and meaningful experience for all participants. 


## Planning - Logistics 

Planning an event involves many stages that can vary in length depending on the size and resources required. 
This section addresses some suggested areas for consideration for events that include people with lived experience as attendees. 

At each stage, your planning documents should reflect an emphasis on accessible and inclusive universal design. 

## Initial Planning 

An event that will be attended by people with lived experience may be different to events run without inclusivity in mind. 

By being inclusive at the planning stages, it ensures that people without lived experience are not making decisions without the input of people with lived experience. 
In particular actively involve a community representative or person with lived experience in the event planning process will help to ensure both a diverse perspective, 
and that the accessibility requirements unique to your attendees are identified. 

To identify the event's purpose and outcomes, carefully consider your target audience and the reasons behind their inclusion. 
It is important at this stage to define and document that the purpose of public involvement in the event alongside a representative or member of the public with lived experience (cite: NIHR public involvement guidance). 

It is important to clearly define the event's goals, understand the intended audience and potential attendees, and to emphasize the importance of including people with lived experiences throughout the event. 

During the initia planning, organiziers can prioritize inclusion by deciding how accessibility requirements are going to be met at a level suitable for all attendees. 
This suitable level should be discussed and defined by people with lived experience and the specific accessibility need. 
This includes considering physical and cognitive accessibility, communication needs, and any other accommodations necessary. 

Finally, when developing the event agenda, make sure it is inclusive of all attendees. Consider various perspectives, backgrounds, and needs, to create an agenda that fosters an inclusive and engaging experience for everyone involved.

### Addressing Power Dynamics

Acknowledging and addressing the power and priviledge differences between members of the public and researchers is an important part of creating an inclusive environment where people with lived experience are able to engage equitably at an event. 

It can be helpful to acknowledge that people with lived experience are "experts by experience" to help establish equal footing with professionals and researchers who are "experts by profession". 

Your event may be the first research or formal event attended by people with lived experience and members of the public, and they may not have pursued higher education compared with attendees who may be researchers by profession. 
This can create a sigificiant power imbalance due to comfort and experience at the event. Networking and social components of the event may feel less welcoming to people with lives experience if they do not know anyone before attending. 
Researchers, especially in niche fields, may know each other quite well or may be more comfortable joining discussions with others who share the same project or university. 
Try to consider ways to open discussion between attendees to avoid a social separation between researchers and members of the public. 

Additionally, many signifiers of social class can be learnt and acquired by research professionals during their career, such as how to present and speak confidently, a familarity of technology and scientific advances, 
as well general comfort navigating university campuses. When unaddressed, many members of the public with lived experience may feel unwelcome at research focused events and feel unable to take part due to a percieved difference in experience and power. 
Where possible, try to surface hidden knowledge such as what to wear, when to ask questions during a talk, and provide tutorials and support for all attendees if your event requires the use of a particular technology like Slack or Slido. 

There are many ways to address the power imbalance and it is best to get reccomendations from your community to tailor to your event. 
By building rapport and respect between attendees, it can help your event in fostering meaningful collaboration and knowledge exchanges between researchers and people with lived experience. 

During the opening session, try to encourage open and respectful dialogue between all attendees and create spaces where attendees can ask questions, share their persepctive, and engage meaningfully in conversations. 
This may require active facilitation of conversations to support attendees with lived experience having time to speak and to ensure that a respective dialogue is maintained. 
It can also be useful to allow attentees to self-identify and differentiate by interest rather than by profession (for example by labeling networking tables with a topic, 
or putting only name and pronouns on name badges instead of including someone's name, profession, and university affiliation or workplace).

Depending on the event length and resources avaliable, it may be helpful to provide training on effective communication and collaboration to both experts by profession and experts by experience attendees. 
Supporting the development of scientific communication skills for all attendees can help bridge any gaps in understanding and enable all attendees to engage in discussion on an equal footing. 
raining sessions could be part of the event promotional schedule if there is several months and resources to run workshops before the event, or can also be featured in the program as one of the initial events.

You can also work towards organizing the event sessions, whether that be panels, facilitators, attendees, or session leads to feature a diverse range of people that includes researchers, professionals, and people with lived experience. 
The equal representation of the attendees by the speakers and facilitators allows for different perspectives to be highlighted and can create a space where people with lived experience feel empowered to engage in sessions. 

Finally, as organizers is is important to understand the power you have in deciding how inclusive and accessible your event will be. 
It is important to acknowledge how your choices may impact the experience and inclusion of people with lived experience at your event.

### Timeline and Timing of Event 

After identifying the "why" and "who" for your event, it is important to plan "when" the event will take place, and to develop a timeline for when tasks need to be completed in order to run your event. 

Organizers should aim to avoid scheduling events on national holidays or religious and cultural days to accommodate attendees of various backgrounds, and depending on the scale of the event, 
you may also want to consider avoiding other days and timings that would make it difficult to attend for your audience. 
For example, events during school holidays or sessions that overlap with school pick-up and drop-off times may make it difficult for people with school age children to attend. 

You should seek to work with your specific community to understand what their needs may be. 
Many members of the public and people with lived experience may engage in research projects as a volunteer and will find it difficult to get time off from their workplace to attend an event. 
Similarly, researchers may find it difficult to attend sessions outside of working hours. 

Although scheduling is difficult for any form of event organizing, please take the time to consider what barriers that an event's timing will have on your ability to be inclusive of people with lived experience and 
refer to your local area for any specific dates to avoid, and you can view an interfaith events calender here: https://www.interfaith-calendar.org/. 

When planning the dates for the event, it is also useful to consider the potential travel times of your attendees. 
If your event takes place in person, try to choose a date and start time that takes in to account how long your attendees will need to travel. 
For example, having your event start at 10:30am to allow for inter-city travel the morning before the event. 



#### Creating a Planning Timeline

Your planning timeline will vary greatly based on the scale of your event. 
We have highlighted areas where your timeline should take into account any considerations that would be specifically supportive of people with lived experience.

Although it is always necessary to allow for appropriate time to source speakers, people with lived experience may require more notice than is traditionally planned for in order to support their attendance and speak at an event. 
People with lived experience may have additional constraints such as medical appointments, caring responsibilities, support and travel needs, and preparation time which can require significant time in order to plan for and implement. 
Try to identify potential speakers as early as possible in planning and book dates in their diaries that would allow them to make plans that would support their engagement in the event.

Where possible, try to arrange a recording of a talk or an alternative session plan that can be used in the event a speaker or facilitator is unable to attend. 
You can also arrange to have speakers join remotely if it would be more supportive of their engagement. 

**Case Study:**
The AI for Muliple Long Term Conditions Conference in April 2023 had a keynote speaker join and give their keynote address remotely in order to best support their involvement. 
People with the lived experience of multiple long-term conditions may find travelling to events taxing which can have a negative impact on their energy levels and ability to engage in daily activities. 
By supporting the speaker to speak remotely, they were able to give an engaging and thoughful keynote address without the burden of having to travel. 

### GDPR and Data Protection

Data concerning health conditions and disability is considered "special category data" under GDPR. This also extends to cover a relative or carer of an individual with a health condition or disability. 
Depending on the specific attendees and focus of your event, you may need to complete additional data protection forms, and plan for how to manage the protected information. 
This includes dietary information and disability status as disclosed in registration forms. Data management and privacy procedures will differ between organizations, 
but it is important during planning to be aware that information being collected may be special category and to establish a protocol for collecting and storing this information. 

Please refer to your organization's policy on data protection and privacy and seek advice from your Data Protection Officer. 

### Budget

Attending and organizing events can place a large financial strain on all parties involved, and can cause cause the unintentional exclusion for many people with lived experience who may be engaging in projects as a volunteer. 
This section highlights considerations that event organizers can make to increase the inclusion of an event, however we would like to acknowledge that not all of these recommendations are possible to implement for every event. 
Please work with your team and the resources avaliable to address the most urgent needs of your attendees and use this section as a starting point for discussion.

Some areas of consideration may be:

#### Ticket Pricing

If you event is ticketted, ticket prices should be set throughtfully and may consider having different tiers of pricing in addition to setting aside low cost or complimentary tickets for carers and those experiencing finacial hardship.

#### Honorarium and Bursaries 

Depending on the size of the budget and structure, creating a policy and the budget for an Accessibility Fund can help to make your event inclusive for all participants, regardless of their needs and circumstances. 
This is a Fund that can be applied to cover additional costs that would support people with lived experience attending and engaging in your event. These additions costs could be: 
- additonal accomodation for people who may need to travel to an event the day prior, or stay longer, if attending in person due to health conditions.
- any travel costs or support for those with caring responsibilities to cover the cost a support worker, childcare, or allowing their child to travel with them.
- honorarium for members of the public with lived experience to attend sessions. 
- honorariums for speakers, facilitators, and note takers if they are needed for your event.
- support for accessibility requirements such as a Sign Langugage Interpretor.
- reimbursements for accessible transport (for example, taxis can often be more expensive than public transport but may be required depending on the location of your event).

It will be important to create a clear and understandable policy for what activities and costs can be covered by an Accessibility fund. 
Honorariums and Reimbursements may have separate policies and timelines, and it is important to be as transparent as possible in order to support people with lived experience engaging in your event. 
It is advisible to highlight who is responsible for payments, how any reimbursement procedures will work and their expected timeline, and clear guidance on what expenses will be covered. 

Please ensure that all documentation and communication about honorarium and reimbursements are written in an easy read format following plain language guidance and if possible, provide clear pathways on how to submit documents. 
People with lived experience may not have a printer in their homes and may share a computer or smart phone to take part in events. 
Where possible, please be mindful of the technology and process barriers that people may face and make processes as clear as possible.

**Case Study:**
A community event attended by people with vision impairments requested a support person to type and guide them through a reimbursement form. 
While this may not be a requirement for all types of events, consider both the budget, communication, and the GDPR requirements that would be needed for a member of staff to support attendees with the completing forms. 


### Risk Assessment

Many organizations will require a risk assessment as part of planning an event and it is critical to consider the additional risks that may be unique to the attendees of your specific event. 
Identifying any risks and mitigation strategies specific to your attendees will be critical in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of people with lived experience at your event. 

You can find some examples below, however it will be best to get feedback from, or include in planning, a representative from the community to consider the specific needs of the community you are working with at your event. 
The examples provided can act as a guide, but will not be able to replace directly working with your community to identify potential risks. 

* **Potential Risk: PTSD Triggers** An event run for people with lived experience of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may need to consider the risk of session material and discussion inadvertently triggering the PTSD in some attendees. As part of risk mitigation, organizers can explore ways to identify and label potential triggering material and make attendees aware of when potentially triggering content is featured at the event. It would also be suggested to provide a quiet space, resources, and onsite counselling for individuals who may be affected at the event. 

* **Potential Risk: Allergic Reaction and Service Animals** Some attendees may rely on service animals to nagivate and and attend the event. It wil be important to keep spaces well ventilated and to inform attendees that animals will be present to ensure the safety of attendees with animal or pet hair allergies. Clear and timely communication can help manage this as a potential risk.

* **Potential Risk: Mobility Impairment** Mobility impairments can make it difficult for attendees to stand unaided for long periods of time, as well as increasing the risk of trip and fall hazards. If your event features a poster session, consider providing additional seating or hosting posters at booths. Adequate seating and accessible pathways can help to to minimize risk and ensure the safety of attendees with mobility impairments.

* **Potential Risk: Sickness Transmission and Immunocompromised Attendees** Immunocompromised attendees will be more susceptible to illness. When organzing your event, the risk to attendees can be reduced by such as providing hand sanitizers, promoting mask-wearing, encouraging people who are feeling ill to stay at home, and offering virtual attendance options if feasible. 

* **Potential Risk: Safety of Individuals with Cognitive Impairments** hosting an in-person event for people with lived experience of neurodegenerative disorders or cognitive impairments that takes place at an unfamiliar location may cause distress for attendees, and put attendees at greater risk or harm when traveling to and from the location. It is important to consider alternative event options (such as remote or hybrid) and to consider how to will safely ensure that attendees are able to return to their place of residence. 
 
By engaging and gathering feedback from your community, and including a representative of your attendees, you will be well positioned to identify and address potential risks effectively. 
The consideration and mitigation of risks will help to ensure that your event is accessible and welcoming to all attendees.

### Personnel 

Planning for who will be facilitating and staffing the event will help to identify what capacity your event will have to provide direct support to people with lived experience. 

Consider what sessions your event will be running, and scope out who will be required to support attendees with lived experience engaging in the event. 
For example facilitators who can moderate and chair conversations or discussion sessions and support equal participation, translators or interpreters for 
people with lived experience if the event is not hosted in their primary language where their input it critical to the event (this includes sign language interpreters), note takers, 
and support staff trained to support the specific needs of your attendees. 

Large scale conferences may also consider dedicating a member of staff for each day of the conference who is fully informed of all accessibility and support needs and will be able to provide assistance and information to attendees with lived experience. 

Although not all events will require a full team of support staff, it is useful to consider how organizers will support people with lived experience on the day of the event. 


### Equality Impact Assessment 

Depending on the size of the event and the organization you are work with, you may be required to complete a formal Equality Impact Assessment. 

An Equality Impact Assessment is a way to identify the possible impacts that an event (or other activity) may have on the community, and to help develop a plan to minimize any negative impacts. 
It helps in ensuring that events and activities are equitable, fair, and that plans are able to meet the needs of the community.

Depending on your organization, an Equality Impact Assessment may ask you to consider and address the barriers and inequalities that attendees may experience in attending or taking part in your event. 
These forms often ask how you plan to address or minimize any potential negative impacts, as well as how you will measure if your plan was successful at addressing the barriers and inequalities. 

Even if this is not a requirement of your organization, we would suggest discussing some of the considerations included in a Equality Impact Assessment process as part of planning. 
The points below can be used to help guide this discussion: 
- How have you identified and explored the potential equalities impacts on your proposed activity? (for example: have you spoken to members of the community who would be attending the event)
- How will the age, gender, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, race, socioeconomic background, and parental and marital status of attendees impact attendance and engagement in your event?
- Will engagement in any aspects of your event be impacted by an individual's disability? 
- What other inequalities may impact an attendee's ability to fully and equaitably engage in your event?


### Safeguarding

Although the term "people with lived experience" encompasses an intentionally wide range of circumstances, depending on your field and your event, 
the specific attendees with lived experience may need additional safeguarding depending on what your event's "lived experience" is focused on. 

In the UK, Safeguarding refers to the protection of people's health, wellbeing and human rights, and the proactive support necessary for people to live free from harm, 
abuse and neglect (cite: quality care commission or NHS - https://www.england.nhs.uk/safeguarding/about/). 
Depending on your country and organization, "safeguarding" may be part of your Risk Assessment processes, or may be called something else entirely. 

Minors and people under the age of 18, people with lived experience of autism (autistic people), people with lived experience of dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive impairments, a
nd/or prior experience of abuse may be at a greater risk of being taken advantage of and therefore require additional considerations and protections if attending your event. 

Your event may want to consider having a "Designated Safeguarding Officer" (often refered to as either a "DSO" or "Designated Safeguarding Lead" in the UK) as part of safeguarding procedures. 
A Designated Safeguarding Officer is an official role who will handle and manage safeguarding reports and is a point of contact throughout the event. 
They will be the point of contact for any legal, medical, or social services that may need to be contacted and is generally a senior organizer or member of staff.

You may consider organizing safeguarding training for staff and organizers who will be attending the event which can help to prepare and train organizers in identifying the types of abuse and indicators, 
as well as how to report concerns about safeguarding and manage disclosure at the event. Depending on your event, the disclosure of experiencing harm, as well as the medical conditions and health status of attendees, 
may be shared as part of discussion with people with lived experience. It is important to consider how you will handle potential disclosure and what you will do to uphold the personal safety of an 
individual who discloses personal information unknowinly in a public forum at your event. 

By creating a safeguarding policy that covers the reporting and escalation pathways and making this accessible to staff and attendees you will be better prepared to manage any events of disclosure 
and uphold the necesary safeguarding for your attendees. 

Please also remember that safeguarding applies to both attendees and staff and it is important to consider the physical and psychological safety of staff at your event, as well as your attendees.

## Before the Event

### Speakers and Moderators 
Consider how you will support your speakers, moderators, and attendees being welcomed and comfortable with the technology your event will use. Many of the technologies used every day by some people have never been used by others. 

We suggest preparing intoductions to the technologies used by your event, and hosting a "practice" session with your speakers and moderators before the event to ensure their familiarity and comfort. 


## At the Event

### Speakers and Moderators
For speakers and moderators, you should consider how you will support them before their sessions and if they would be best supported by having an opportunity to prepare in a "Green Room" or quiet room before the session. 
This may be especially for people with lived experience who may prefer to take medication in private or may be newer to public speaker than their research colleagues.

Consider how you will set them up to hold a successful session whether that be hosting a practice session for them before attendees arrive, identifying some questions or topics they may want to avoid and helping to facilitate discussion, 
or by asking how they wish to be introduced to the attendees. 

If your event overlaps with a meal time, consider if their ability to eat or take a break will be impacted. If your event is in person, try to communicate with catering and ensure that there is a meal or alternative food is sourced 
and held aside for them. 

### Technology 

Depending on your event and platform, it may be helpful to organize "back up" technology on the day of the event. For example having spare batteries and spare  microphone, arranging an alternate host for Zoom, 
and providing pdfs instead of relying solely on online technology to communicate important information. Many populations do not carry around a smart phone or laptop and may have not used streaming or presentation software before. 

Make sure anyone who is interacting with this technology feels comfortable using it on the day. 

### Personnel 

Earlier in planning, you should have considered who will be needed at the event to support the involvement of people with lived experience. 

At the event, it is important to have clear communication and identification of staff and organizers especially if their roles are to support attendees. 

You may want to consider having a pdf, website page, or paper copy introducing the event organizers and facilitators so that is it clear who to ask for help. 
You may want to highlight people who are able to help if an attendee has a question about accomodation, or the location of accessible rest rooms as these people may be different from session facilitators and technology support staff. 
By including contact details and explaining the roles of organizers, it can help attendees feel understood and welcomed instead of being redirected to mutliple people who are unable to help them. 

If possible, it can also be helpful to have a dedicated person who can be easily located and contacted during the event that is able to take action if there is a problem 
(for example. if an elevator is broken, restroom blocked, accessible doors not opening, or audio induction loop not working). 
This person could be avalible during event registration or at the start of the event to introduce themselves provide assistance to those who need it. 
This may not be feesible for all events and may be more important for in person events, but it is important to consider how to make the event accessible and inclusive throughout. 
Inclusion can be planned for, but it also needs implementation and support to make it happen.

## After the Event

Consider if you are able to make content from the event accessible to attendees, or open to a wider audience, after the event. 

For events that have recorded sessions, this may be uploading the content to YouTube and ensuring that the captions have been reviewed and added to any video content. 
Having a human reviewer of captions can be helpful in catching any errors made by automatic captioning software and ensuring that content is of a good quality 
(such as editing out any audio glitches and flagging triggers for photosensitive epilepsy). 

If your event included content such as slides or documented notes, consider where and how you will archive them so that they can be accessed and referenced by attendees. 
Online repositories such as Zenodo are commonly used by research communities, but are not universally design compliant and require both technical expertise and 
knowledge of how to use and access it as well as and requiring an internet connection to access content. Consider using Zenodo in addition to an accessible format. 
This could be a website commonly visited by your attendees, sending a post-event summary information to attendees, or providing recording of sessions that display session content.

Finally, for in-person events and related to safeguarding, consider how you will ensure that everyone is able to access return transport safely. 
This is particularly important to consider for attendees with lived experience and any disabilities that may make public transport more difficult to access. 
Although your event may have formally finished, are there support pathways you can put in place such as arranging a coach or taxis to a train station, 
or by ending an event within daylight hours to ensure that attendees are not traveling in the dark?
