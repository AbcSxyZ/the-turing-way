# Planning an Inclusive Event

Running an event that is inclusive of all is more than just a choice; it’s a necessity to ensure that all your participants will be able to fully engage in the event. 
Inclusion is more than a buzzword - it’s a commitment to ensuring that every individual regardless of their background, abilities, or current circumstances has equal opportunity to participate and thrive. 

For many projects, the involvement of individuals and communities with first-hand lived experience is critical to upholding and ensuring that the processes and outcomes developed are effective, inclusive, and equitable. 
This can involve hosting different events that are attended by people with lived experience and other members of the public, as well as researchers, clinical staff, and other professionals. 

This section provides guidance and considerations for how to design and host an inclusive event for a diverse audience of people with lived experience. 

The recommendations are not an exhaustive list, and it is always preferable to include a specific representative or person with lived experience in the event planning to ensure that your event is tailored to the needs of your specific attendees. 
Their inclusion in decision-making processes is essential to achieving an accessible and inclusive event.


## Accessibility vs. Inclusion: What to focus on

When designing and organising an event, it can be easy to focus on the accessibility requirements of the venue and overlook the steps needed to make an event inclusive and enjoyable for all participants. 

We can think of this in terms of “Universal Design” which is about designing an event or environment so that it can be accessed, understood, and used by all people regardless of their background, age, size, ability or disability. 

This is different from “Accessible Design” which focuses on designing around specific accessibility requirements. 

Developing an event for a specific community, or to include a specific group of people with lived experience can put a larger emphasis on specific accessibility features that would be needed to run an inclusive event 
(for example, ensuring materials in braille are provided and using high contrast colours in any visual material for attendees with visual impairments).

In order to organise an event for people with lived experience, accessibility requirements of your specific attendees should be identified early and accounted for throughout each stage, 
and your event should consider using universal design guidelines to ensure your event is as inclusive as possible. 

Organising an inclusive event is more than a legal requirement, it is about creating a more equitable, welcoming, and meaningful experience for all participants.
