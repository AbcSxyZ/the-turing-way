# Location

The location of your event plays a pivotal role in supporting or hindering how accessible and inclusive your event will be for people with lived experience.

This section provides guidance that is most relevant for in-person or hybrid events. 

Whether it's a conference, seminar, or any gathering, the venue's physical location, its layout, and surrounding infrastructure can significantly 
influence the experience of attendees with lived experience, especially those with disabilities. 
See below for a specific list of considerations to review when touring and comparing potential locations.

Identifying and addressing the access needs of your attendees will help to both foster a welcoming environment and ensure that all attendees are able to fully engage in your event.

(cl-inclusive-events-choosing-venue)=
## Choosing a Venue

Although buildings may list accessibility features, before deciding on a venue is it recommended to have an organizer or member of the team visit potential venues 
to do a walk-through and check that all rooms in the venue have accessible entrances and navigation. 
This can be helpful to both check the maintenance and usability of a location's accessibility features, but can also help you plan your event set-up such as where to put signs directing attendees to your event. 

The walkthrough should be used to check the accessibility of entrances and doors, as well as the location of accessible restrooms and elevators, 
and assess how far accessible parking spaces and public transport links are from the location. 
Ensure that there are a sufficient number of accessible restrooms for the number of attendees. 
Try to find a location with gender-neutral restrooms if possible for your location and ensure that they have step-free access.

Venues that cater to accessibility requirements should have elevator access if any components of the event are held not on ground level, 
and where possible consider venues with more than one elevator in case one breaks down or is inaccessible on the day of the event. 

If your event is a multi-day or a full-day event that would require in-person attendees to travel, consider the proximity to accommodation 
and how far attendees will need to travel to get from the event location to their accommodation. 
Many large venues have accommodation on-site and can be prioritized for attendees with lived experience such as those with disabilities or caring responsibilities.

Check with a venue's child policy before booking and ensure that there are suitable arrangements made if a venue area does not allow children to be present. 
For example, some museums and botanical garden greenhouses do not allow children to be present for private events. 
This may mean that attendees with child-caring responsibilities are unable to attend and engage with your event. 

It is also important to check that rooms, doors, restrooms, and all spaces in the venue have step-free access that is wide enough and are able to be accessed by attendees who may use mobility aids. 
For example, ramps should be no steeper than a 1:20 gradient, doors should have a minimum clear opening width of 840mm, and any space where attendees may need to change direction 
should have a 1.5m by 1.5m space which allows for most wheelchairs to turn in a complete circle *(cite: Portsmouth city council: https://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/development-and-planning-design-guide-for-wheelchair-accessible-housing.pdf)*. 
Many motorized wheelchairs may be larger and require additional space to travel and turn.

Note the location of access ramps and assess if you will need to provide additional signage to guide attendees who use the ramps to access the event location. 
Signs should be viewable from a distance and clearly legible.

Ensure that the venue has seating that is suitable for attendees who may use mobility aids and wheelchairs, as well as seating for low-vision and low-hearing attendees. 
Notice if this seating is significantly segregated and how you will make attendees feel welcome and included at the event. 

Depending on the size of your venue, you may consider if there is space available to use as a multi-faith prayer room or a quiet room that reserves a space away from the event to relax, 
take medicine privately, and take a sensory break for those who need it. These spaces can help make an event more inclusive and enjoyable for your attendees. 

When reviewing potential venues, consider the ventilation of airflow, lighting and acoustics, and ensure that they are appropriate for the number of attendees at your event. 
A large hall with high ceilings may echo and not be suitable for discussion-based sessions, and a small room with limited ventilation may not be suited for long sessions with a large number of attendees. 

COVID-19 highlighted the importance of ventilation for the safety and health of event attendees, try to ensure that there is adequate airflow at your venue 
and discuss how you will ensure the safety of attendees who may be immunocompromised. 

If possible, avoid venues that have harsh fluorescent lighting and avoid hosting sessions close to sites of loud electrical noise such as near air conditioning units, 
lifts, escalators, or train lines. 
Many people with sensory processing differences such as autism or hearing impairments may find it difficult to attend and engage in events that do not appropriately mitigate sensory barriers. 
Consider also requesting that attendees avoid strong perfumes or scented products. 

Sensory barriers (airflow, acoustics, lighting, visuals, and smell) can significantly impact the ability your will attendees have to engage in your event. 
It is helpful to recognize that by choosing a venue that can address some of these barriers, you will be able to host an event that is more comfortable and inclusive of all.
  
Finally, consider if your venue is hosted in a space that is "dual purpose". 
For example, a University Hall may also be used for lectures or by students as a thoroughfare to get to class. 
If there will be people other than attendees using the space, identify how will you differentiate between staff, attendees, and others who are present in the space. 
You could use name badges or have staff and organizers in a shared uniform which could help to avoid confusion of an attendee asking a bystander for event assistance. 
Please also be mindful of how your event will use the spaces provided, for example, if your poster presentation space will also be used to serve food in, 
try to ensure that food smells are dissipated and plates cleared to support attendees engaging in the session.

When deciding on a venue, try to choose a venue that has the ability to deliver for both accessibility and inclusion needs, and will be a welcoming space to all attendees. 

#### Resources:
Portsmouth City Council in the UK have compiled a booklet called [Design Guide for Wheelchair-accessible Housing](https://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/development-and-planning-design-guide-for-wheelchair-accessible-housing.pdf) 
that can be used as a reference for assessing venues for their ability to be accessed by wheelchair users. 

(cl-inclusive-events-transport)=
## Considering Transport Links

When planning an inclusive event for people with lived experience, careful consideration of transportation is essential to ensure that all attendees will be able to access the venue comfortably and safely.

As part of resource planning and depending on the resources available, you may want to consider allocating budget related to the Accessibility fund that can be dedicated to addressing transportation needs. 
For example, supporting bursaries that cover train tickets and travel for carers and support workers who may need to travel alongside an attendee. 

You should also consider what other access requirements your attendees may require. 
A multi-day event may involve a social dinner at a separate location which would require the organization of accessible transport options, shuttle services, or potentially a subsidy for attendees with mobility challenges who arrange their own transportation. 

The provision of sufficient parking, including accessible parking, is important as some participants may prefer travelling by car due to mobility impairments. 
Try to ensure that there is adequate parking so that all attendees who wish to travel by car are able to park at no disadvantage. 
You may want to consider if your event can reimburse attendees who need to access paid parking if there are no designated parking spaces at the venue. 

In addition to sufficient parking, when visiting a venue try to check if both parking lots, and the paths to access any parking or transport links, are well-lit. 
Proper lighting reduces the risk of falls or injury in the dark and enhances safety and helps individuals navigate comfortably, particularly for those who may have visual impairments or mobility difficulties. 
If your event does start or end outside of daylight hours, try to organize transport or a walking group that guides people directly to and from the venue to allow people to walk together as a group. 

Events such as networking and formal dinners that continue into the evening should prioritize having well-lit pathways and common areas to ensure that attendees can move about comfortably and safely. 

Finally, organizers should consider the availability of taxi services in the local area close to the event location. 
If possible, designate a member of staff or organizer to be responsible for assisting attendees in arranging taxi bookings who will be available in the lead-up to the event, 
and also available on the day to ensure that all booked taxis have arrived. 
Having a point of contact person who can facilitate transportation arrangements can be invaluable, especially for people with lived experience who rely on taxi services due to mobility impairments. 

By addressing any barriers that transportation access may cause, event organizers can ensure that attendees with lived experience feel welcomed and are able to engage fully in the event.


(cl-inclusive-events-catering)=
## Catering

Depending on the length of your event and the venue's capabilities, you may need to consider how your event will be catered. 
Catering can range from formal dinners and lunches, providing refreshments such as coffee, tea and water alongside snack food, to a "per diem" food budget for attendees.

This section is most relevant for events that include catered food or host sessions that overlap with commonly observed meal times. 

Many people with lived experience of health conditions may have strict dietary requirements or experience a severe food allergy. 
In both these cases, it is incredibly important to handle food safely, and in a way that does not create a hazard to their health. 
Ensure that any dietary requirements of attendees are documented clearly and securely, and that requirements are communicated effectively to catering and event staff. 
Make arrangements so that any caterers or contractors you are using to provide food or drink for the event are able and willing to comply with accommodation requests related to allergens, food sensitivities, or preferences. 
This can include allergens such as peanuts, gluten, wheat, soy, shellfish, sugar (sucrose), and lactose, as well as vegan, vegetarian, kosher, halal, and any medically prescribed dietary restrictions. 

As a default, when organizing catering ensure that there is a range of options that is dairy-free, celiac (coeliac), vegetarian, vegan, kosher and halal. 
Many dietary restrictions and preferences can overlap so it is not always necessary to have entirely separate choices for each restriction. 
Try to work towards having enough selection so that attendees are able to adhere to their dietary needs without having to strictly ration. 

If your event uses buffet-style food, options should be clearly labelled with dietary information and potential allergens. 
Try to include the ingredients list on table cards to help attendees with specific dietary concerns identify suitable options more easily. 

If your meal includes a "sit down" or formal service, try to prioritize the serving of dietary requirement, or accommodated meals first. 
This can allow for any additional time that may be needed to fix a catering error and keep attendees with severe allergies safe. 
Try to do this in a way that is not timed so separately from the rest of the meals that accommodated meals are finished or sitting with cold food while waiting for the remaining meals to be served. 
By working to avoid segregating meals in time, it ensures that everyone can enjoy their meals simultaneously and feel equally able to engage in conversation over meals. 

You should also consider the needs of attendees with specific mobility or sight impairments during breaks and mealtimes, especially if the food is buffet-style. 
Providing support, such as assistance in carrying plates of food and drinks, ensures that these individuals can navigate the catering area comfortably. 

If your event is hosted in person but does not provide meals or snacks, consider creating a list of nearby restaurants that offer a variety of dietary options, 
including vegetarian, vegan, kosher, and gluten-free food. This can be helpful in supporting attendees unfamiliar with the area to locate food suitable for them. 

Lastly, for events coinciding with Ramadan, you should consider making arrangements to accommodate attendees who are fasting. 
For example, by extending available catering times so that food can be prepared and accessed after sunset and before dawn. 
You may also consider splitting or adjusting meal times so that groups of attendees have the option of eating meals together. 
For example by providing earlier meals to attendees who require it such as those who experience fatigue or have caring duties for children with an early bedtime, and then a later meal after sunset for those who wish to stay up. 

As with many of the examples suggested in the chapter, it can be difficult to find a "perfect answer" that caters to the specific needs of all attendees. 
The most important step is to identify how you will work to be inclusive of your attendees. 
In this example, it may not be possible to have all attendees eat at the same time.
As organizers, you may decide that offering separate meal times to ensure that attendees are catered for is more important than having everyone in the same room at the same time. 
It is incredibly beneficial to work with a representative with lived experience to strategize solutions in cases where requirements may seem to conflict. 

(cl-inclusive-events-location-venue)=
## Venue Planning

(cl-inclusive-events-location-signs)=
### Signs and Navigation

Consider how you will direct and guide people at the venue. If you plan to have banners that will displayed near parking and transport links that can direct attendees to the event registration, 
will you also have staff members who will be able to guide attendees with low vision or visual impairments. 

Consider where will you put signs at the venue to indicate where the sessions are taking place, and also where any amenities such as restrooms, elevators, kitchen space, 
and all breakout sessions are located. Signs should be clearly visible and identifiable to your attendees. 
Try to place signs and information before and at junctions so that people do not take a wrong turn down a corridor, and if there are locations at your venue that may be difficult to navigate, 
consider having staff be visible to help direct attendees. Use directional arrows, and have signs be distributed regularly along paths. 

Although they may help some individuals, remember that signs and visual information may not be accessible to all attendees and consider how to provide clear 
guidance at the venue to attendees with visual impairments. 

It is also important to be cognizant that attendees who are more familiar with the layout of University campuses may feel more comfortable navigating university-based locations. 
Please consider how you will make members of the public feel comfortable in these spaces. 

If you are able to provide attendees with a map of the venue, make sure to identify how to navigate the location, where parking and restrooms are located, 
where to find staff members, and where all important locations will be (such as kitchen, break out rooms, and registration). 
Also ensure that the location of any emergency supplies such as an AED, epi-pen, first aid kit and a member of staff who will be able to act in the event of an emergency is marked on the map. 
Although is it not expected for staff and organizers to be medically trained, it is important to know who needs to be contacted in an emergency event. 

(cl-inclusive-events-location-emergency-plan)=
### Emergency Evacuation Plan

Although the hope is that your event will be successful and without incident, it is important to ensure that emergency evacuation procedures take 
into account the needs of people with mobility and sensory disabilities in the event of an emergency. 

Disabled people who require assistance in an evacuation will need to be advised of the options available to them ahead of the event. 
You may need to arrange a separate meeting place for people inside the venue during the event where they will be met by support personnel, 
and you may also need to consider how you will ensure an accurate headcount of attendees if people are evacuated to a separate location. 
"Headcounts" are vital in ensuring that all attendees have been safely evacuated, so knowing how you will account for, and communicate with, 
people who have been evacuated to separate locations is an incredibly important step. 

In the UK is it the responsibility of the location to provide a fire safety risk assessment that includes an emergency evacuation plan for 
all people likely to be on the premises (cite: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/886446/9446_Means_of_Escape_v2_.pdf). 
You may need to proactively communicate with the location staff or owners to provide information about your attendees' needs and safely develop an evacuation plan. 

More information about Emergency Evacuation Plans for people with disabilities and mobility restrictions can be found on the UK Government Website: 
- https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-means-of-escape-for-disabled-people
- https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/886446/9446_Means_of_Escape_v2_.pdf

(cl-inclusive-events-location-setup)=
## Setting up the event

Before your event starts, it will be important to check that all accessibility measures are functioning and able to be used by attendees. 

Ensure the entrance doors’ automatic openers are activated and that there is a level, smooth, and accessible surface throughout the venue. 
It can often be the case that automatic door openers are available, but not activated. 

Check that accessible restrooms are open and are compliant with the local accessibility standards.
In the UK this is [Document M](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-and-use-of-buildings-approved-document-m).
You can find a summary of Document M's content and other information about how to ensure that accessible restrooms are safe for use in the [All About Emergency Cords](https://accessible-toilets.co.uk/2019/02/07/all-about-emergency-cords/) resource.
This can be checking that the emergency assistance cord can be accessed, and that restroom facilities are open.


If your event involves any sessions that would require attendees to stand for a long amount of time, 
try to make seating available where it will not cause a trip hazard but also supports people taking part in the session. 
For example, poster sessions are common at academic conferences but require a significant amount of time standing and walking between posters. 
Consider having booth-based presentation areas that would allow both the presenter and attendees to sit while listening to the poster presentation. 

Depending on the location and setting of your event, try to ensure that any tables where attendees will sit are an appropriate height to accommodate wheelchairs, 
and that seating is reserved for people who may have access requirements in order to engage with the session content. 
For example, people who are hearing impaired need to be seated close to sign language interpreters and at a distance where they are able to read captions. 
If your event is using note-takers, try to ensure that they are well-positioned to hear and see content to support their ability to take accurate notes. 

The traditional auditorium layout of many university lecture halls may also disadvantage people who are short-statured. 
Try to ensure that any speakers or moderators are able to access microphones or lecterns that may be used by the event, 
and that attendees have an unobstructed line of sight to any sign language interpreters that your event may have. 

Consider setting out chairs that have enough space for people in wheelchairs, motorised scooter users, 
and people who may be accompanied by service dogs to move comfortably. 
If your event is held at a venue where you are unable to alter the seating layout, consider reserving seating at the end of rows throughout the venue 
for people who may need the space, and avoid dedicating an entire row or completely separate seating area for these attendees. 
Segregated seating and single areas can make attendees feel separate from their colleagues and singled out. 
By distributing the accessible seating throughout a space you can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for attendees. 

Finally, before the event starts, ensure that attendees are able to access the quiet room and multifaith prayer room if you are providing these at your event. 
These should be marked on a map and have clear guidance about where they are located. 


(cl-inclusive-events-location-during-event)=
## During the event

Although most of the accessibility considerations are already thought through and planned for before the event begins, 
while the event is underway there are still things you can do at the location to support people with lived experience. 

Any maps of your venue should have been included in the invitations to attendees, but you should also consider having printed copies of the maps with any important features highlighted. 

Depending on the resources you have for the event, consider having a member of staff whose role is to provide guidance to people with lived experience who want support navigating the location. 
This can have different applications depending on your event, for example, you may have someone posted in the parking lot to help direct attendees to accessible parking bays, 
or it may also mean having someone available at the registration area who can accompany an attendee to a specific location. 


> Where an inaccessible venue can present barriers that hinder participation and severely limit the ability of people with lived experience to engage in your event, 
a universally inclusive venue can make your attendees feel comfortable, supported, and welcomed.
