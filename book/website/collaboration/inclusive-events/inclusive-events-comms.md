# Planning Communications for Inclusive Events

## Introduction

Transparency and clear communication is critical so that people with lived experience are able to make informed decisions about whether to engage in your event. Any of the other decisions you have made may not be helpful in supporting the engagement and inclusion of people with lived experience if you have not communicated about what those decisions are. Even if you have planned the perfect event, if people don't what those plans are, you will not be able to run a successful event.

Creating a communication plan is therefore the key to hosting an accessible and inclusive event for people with lived experience.

This section provides guidance on what to consider when developing a communications plan for events involving people with lived experience. It will not be able to replace an in-depth communications plan, but instead draws attention to what additional considerations may be needed to help make your event inclusive of people with lived experience. 

"Communications" refers to the information you share with attendees, the timings and schedule on which you communicate it, the channels you will use, and the content and information about the event. 

When developing a communications strategy, you need to consider:
- Who is it going to.
- Why it is going to them.
- What will it contain.
- When does it need to be sent.
- How will you convey the information.


Depending on the scale and resources for your event, your communications plan may include the development of websites, PDFs, flyers, banners, and social media posts in addition to email and calendar invites. By carefully planning out what you need to communication, when, and how you ensure that the informaion is recivieved and understood, your attendees will be supported in spending their effort and energy taking part in your event instead of worrying about their access needs.


## Timeline (When)

The timeline for planning a communications schedule for your event will vary greatly depending on the size and type of event. 

When plannng an event for people with lived experience, please be mindful that you will need to allocate more time to plan for - and to implement - accessibility requirements, and that many people with lived experience will require information with as much notice as possible in order to plan their attendance.


### Save the Date
Consider how early you will be able to send out a "Save the Date" for your event and when you will be able to finalize accessibility information and a reimbursement policy. 

Many people with lived experience of disabilities or medical conditions need to carefully plan their attendance as part of managing their condition, especially for in-person events. This can be due to medication requirements, and managing conditions that involve fatigue or overstimulation as well as figuring out a plan for how they will manage physical barriers to arriving at an in-person event. 

Providing clear and timely information will help your attendees with lived experiences plan their attendance safely, and in a way that supports them engaging fully in your event. This will also be supportive of attendees with busy schedules who may be booked out significantly in advance.

Your Save the Date should include an overview of honorarium or reimbursement support, the date, and approximate location of the event such as Zoom, or the name of the City the event will take place in. It should also reference how long the event is likely to be, for example if it's a multi-day event, or a few hours. 

Attendees with a lived experiencing of caring reponsibilities may need to hire and arrange alternative care support in order to attend your event, or could be placed at significant financial disadvantage if they travel and attend. By providing guidance along with a "Save the Date", your attendees would have appropriate time be able to make arrangements, and also be able to make an informed choice about if they are able to attend. 

Consider sending out different forms of a Save the Date to support how different people use and interact online. For example, sending out a online calendar placeholder, a email invitation written in plain text with formatted headings, attching a PDF flyer with Save the Date information, and promoting Save the Date information through your usual communication channels such as Slack, LinkedIn or organization's website and social media. This can ensure that people who use different communication channels are able to recieve the information in a medium that is accessible to them and through the channel they are most comfortably using. 

```
Example:
The Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement Community for people with an experience of Multiple Long-Term Conditions had asked event organizers to send out both calendar invitations compatible with Outlook and Google calendars, as well as email invitations. 

This was to support the community members who often needed to manage event attendance around medical appointments, as well as supporting those who had visual impairments and would benefit from digital tools providing reminders.

Many of the MLTC PPIE Community expressed that they would not regularly check emails and instead would rely on their calendars, however some members of the community expressed the opposite and did not use digital calendars but would download and print out flyers for their notice boards. 

By adjusting communication to support both these requests, organizers were better positioned to support event engagement for their events and were also more successful in involving underrepresented people in community events.
```


### Annoucing your Event 

After a "Save the Date, you may consider sending out a formal invitation to annouceyour event after you have finalized details such as the event program and speaker schedule. 

In this annoucement you should provide information about any specific accessibility and inclusion requirements are adressed such as whether things like captions, interpretation, or other accessibility practices will be available. 

If possible, consider establishing a point of contact on your team who is able to address any questions or concerns that people with lived experience may have about attending your event. This may involve setting up an email inbox such as accessibility@yourevent.com. 

By providing clear and proactive information about how your event addresses barriers to inclusion, people with lived experience will be able to find out whether the event will be accessible to them individually, and deciding if they are able to attend. 
For example, communicating that your event will be hybrid may allow people who otherwise would not engage in the event to attend online. 

This accouncement should also contain information about how to register for the event, the finalized location, and a preliminary program. 


`Autism Advocacy suggests that schedules for multi-day events should be sent at least one month in advance which includes details about transport and its proximity to the event location, training session names, speaker names, breaks, and planned schedule, and at least 2 weeks in advance for events taking place on a single day. (https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Accessible-Event-Planning.pdf)` The Autism Advocacy Accessible Event Planning Guide also contains other reccomendations and timeline guidance for running events for autistic people. 

## Event Website (How will you communicate)
It can be incredibly helpful to centralize information about your event in both online and offline locations.

Consider if your event will need a website and dedicate a page on your site to information and a point of contact reguarding accessibility requirements and the steps you are taking to make the event inclusive for people with lived conditions and accessibility requirements. 

You can also choose an event platform such as Eventbrite, Humanitix, or EventYay to host information about your event. 
When deciding on what platform to use please review the accessibility of a potential site, and follow any advice as to how you can make your content on their platform accessible. 
For example, [Eventbrite provides accessibility guidance](https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/66754-2how-to-creat-an-accessible-event-listing-ds00/) for event pages hosted their platform. 

There are two main considerations for your event website:
**Acessibility** and **Content**. 

### Website Accessibility
Your website should meet Web Accessibility Standards by following the 4 WCAG principles: 
- **Perceivability**, meaning that people who use and arrive to your event website are able to "perceive" all the content on the website using at least one of their senses. This can mean ensuring that any video content is accompanyed by captions, providing Alternative Text descriptions for images, and that any controls or clickable features on the site have text labels that describe the purpose of the feature. For example a button labeled "Sign Up to Newsletter" or "Upload Image". 
- **Operability**, which means that all users can control and interact with any buttons or clickable features. To meet this requirement, ensure that any buttons are able to be interacted with and clicked through different modalities for example a mouse, a keyboard, or voice command. This is especially important for registration forms which often impose a time limit to complete them. Any registration forms you use for your event must have a way to extend - or turn off - the time limit function for completing the form. If you are using an external registration website, please check the accessibility guidance of that site to ensure that this feature is enabled. It is incredibly important for people who use screen readers and others who may need more time to read and complete a form due to dyslexia, familiarity with the event's host language, or any other reason that impacts reading and language comprehension. Operability also requires that webpages to have a informative title for the content on the page.
- **Understandability** refers a lot to content being written in easy read, or plain language formats which is discussed in more depth below. [****] The Web Accessibility guidelines ask that any echnical terms, jargon, idioms, slang and abbreviations be accompanyied by a definition. And ideally your site will also contain references to a Glossary that is linked to when those word appear. You may need to develop a Glossary specific to your event and area, or consider what Glossaries have been developed by research funding bodies or University Communications teams and provide links if applicable. 
- Finally, **Robustness**. Robustness refers to the importance of content on your event page's website being compatible with different browsers, now and in the future, and how compatible the content is with different technologies such as screen readers and other assistive technologies. 

[Mozilla's Developer Documentation on Web Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG) provides a good overview of how to meet these 4 web accessibility atandards and also provides more examples of how to meet each critieria. 
If you are interested in learning more, you can also review the full guidance published by the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

### Website Content 

Depending on your event and where you host online information, you Ensure that your event information covers:
- How to attend (joining links for online content and location information for in-person events).
- When and where you event is.
- What accessibility support there will be for your event
- Who the event hosts are and who the session leads will be. This can help attendees know what to expect. 
- Information about what your event is and what is expected from the audience. This includes if your attendees are expected to have background information on a topic and if your event expects active participation from the attendees. 
- The program or agenda for the event including planned start and end times and scheduled breaks.
- The event's Code of Conduct and Privacy notice.
- Documentation or information about the honorarium, reimburement, or renumeration policy for your event. 
- Information for a point of contact to get in touch with if there are any issues with joining or if attendees want follow up information about the event.

Consider also providing any content that is on a website in an offline format such as a information booklet or flyer. This can help attendees access important event information without requiring internet access and can also help attendees with screen readers or who prefer to read information offline. HTML and plain text is often the most accessible format, and some PDF softwares provides several accessibility features such as Adobe Reader which can be accessed or downloaded for free. 


## Registration
If you are using forms or an external registration software, you need to make sure that the registration forms and platform are accessible for all attendees. This includes ensuring that if a time limit is imposed that it can be changed or turned off as mentioned above in the event website section. 

Check if registration platforms are able to be access by screen reader technology, and ensure that your registration form is written in plain language and meets online accessibility guidance. 

Consider making registration possible by phone, in person, or by email if you are able to support it. By making registration possible through different channels, you are helping to remove technlology barriers that some people with lived experience may face. For example, not all households have a computer with reliable internet access which may make accessing and using online registration forms difficult. 

## Speaker Information

If your event involves people with lived experience, you should consider how to set your speakers, presenters, and facilitators up for success.

You will need to identify and invite your speakers, regardless of their lived experience, well in advance of the event and provide them with support so that they can plan and deliver a successful session.

### Inviting Speakers with Lived Experience

Representation is incredibly important and you may want to consider how you will represent your attendees in your speakers and event facilitators. 

When inviting a speaker with lived experience to present, consider if you are able to support their session and preparation. You may need to provide details about the event ahead of when the information is scheduled to be sent to attendees. This is to ensure that the speaker feels supported and is able to make an informed decision before agreeing to present at your event. 

Ask the speaker if they require any support or accomodations and ensure that these are met to their satisfaction so that they are able to deliver their session effectively. For example, ensuring that there is an appropriately trained and qualified sign language interpreter who is able to work with a deaf or hard of hearing speaker. 

### Speakers Information 

Ask them how they would like to be identified. If your event is supporting a speaker or facilitator with lived experience, consider asking how they wish to be identified in relation to their expertise and experience. For example, many autistic people, and the autistic community as a collective, have expressed a preference for using "Identify-first" language which places the disability first in the description. This is contrasted with "Person-first" language which emphasizes the person before the disability, for example, Person with epilepsy. Many people feel strongly about person or identity based language and it is important to ask that individual about their preference as part of planning their introduction. 

You may notice that we have used both person-first, and identity-first language has been used in this chapter. How a person chooses to self-identify is entirely a personal decision, and it is the role of organizers and facilitators to support the choices of the speakers and attendees, as long as it does not contravene the event's Code of Conduct. Consider instead including a statement on the inclusive and compassionate use of both person-first and identity-first language when opening your event. 


### Speaker Preparation

Depending on the type of event you are planning, you may want to consider providing guidance for speakers, moderators, and presenters on inclusive communication, and requesting that any content delivered in the session can be sent to attendees prior to the event. 

If your event has online or streamed sessions, consider developing an information pack and working with your speakers and event facilitators to ensure that content is accessible and inclusive of all attendees. This information pack can contain guidance on how to present so that attendes with sensory processing differences or hearing impairments are able to engage in the session content. For example, reccomending that speakers remain as still as possible while they are speaking and presenting, and requesting that online presenters are well lit with a blurred background will help support an attendess that rely on lip and face reading to engage in a session.

You can also include information about the audidence and provide guidance on how to effectively communicate to an audience of people with lived experience. Many early career researchers may not have recieved formal training in scientific communication and working with the public, so it can be helpful to emphasize the importance of using plain language and speaking clearly. 

You can also prepare the speakers by asking how they would like to interact with any questions that are asked. Many research talks often follow a "lecture" format where a speaker talks on a topic and then takes 2-3 questions from the audience. Consider asking your speaker to break their talk into sections to allow for questions at different points in the session, or if youre event is a lecture, consider using software to gather questions as the session progresses. This can be helpful for people with lived experience of cognitive or sensory differences. 


### Who will be attending
People with lived experience may experience additional anxiety due to being in an unfamiliar environment where they can often feel like their presence is tokenistic. If you have planned your event well, attendees with lived experience should be feeling welcomed and able to engage fully in the event.

It can be helpful in your communications to state who will be in attendance (for example "researchers, clinicians, policy makers, funding bodies, people with lived experience")

Finally, consider including short introductions and background information about the speakers and session facilitators in your event information. Many people with lived experience may feel more confortable engaging in an event where they know who they are speaking with and it can be a helpful way to build rapport. 


#### Presentation Slides and Event Content

Although it is common in research to prepare presentation slides at the penultimate hour, to be as inclusive as possible, please work with your speakers and presenters to finalize session content before the event. By requesting slides and presentation content ahead of the event you will be be best set up to support the involvement of people with disabilities and lived experience at your event. 

Consider how you will support speakers developing accessible and inclusive material. This may mean developing and sharing guidance on session content, or could also be giving feedback on presentation drafts. Ensure that you contact and confirm your speakers with enough notice that allows them to prepare and revise material. Plese refer to the [Accessible Content] section below for more reccomendations on what to include in a speaker guidance pack. 

It is best practice to send out content before the session or event to ensure that people with sensory impairements are able to understand and take part. If this is not possible, please address the reasons why in the opening address of the event and make alternative arrangements, for example, if the information is sensitive and unable to be shared due to Intellectual Property or Privacy reasons. 

If content is able to be shared but was not sent out before the event started consider sending out notes, session minutes, and session content during - or - as soon as possible, after the session. You could also consider taking collaborative notes during the session and making the document link avaliable for attendees. HackMD or Google Docs are reccomended for their accessibility support features, and Etherpad can support a larger number of contributors. Additional guidance on tools for taking collaborative notes can be found in https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/event-tools#creating-shared-notes. 

If information cannot be shared externally and made accessible, consider providing a note taker who is able to provide live notes in a secure location accessible to attendees only for the duration of the event.

Additionally, if your event is a workshop that requires live input from attendees, please make efforts to ensure that questionnaires or any reference material that will be discussed is sent out at least two days prior to the start of the event. This is especially important to support people with visual impairments, cognitive differences, or verbal processing difficulties. 


## Avoiding Jargon

Research fields can often rely on acronyms and jargon to communicate effectiveky between colleagues. However, the use of jargon can make the involvement and inclusion of people with lived experience difficult. 

Reflect on how, and where, your research field uses jargon that might not be understandable to those outside your field. Although you may be able to assume that many people with lived experience are familiar with any common acronyms or jargon used, it can benefit the inclusion of all attendees and experience levels if the amount of jargon used can be minimized. For example, researchers, clinicians and people with a lived experience of arthritis may be more familiar with terms and medication names related to arthritis and associated conditions. However, many attendees may be unfamiliar with these terms, or may be new to the research field. 

As part of planning, consider how you can reduce the use of jargon and acronyms at your event, and create a strategy for supporting speakers and facilitators to also avoid unnecessary jargon. 

You may want to develop a Glossary of Terms that can be included in information booklets, and where possible, work with researchers to be mindful of, and review, language choices to ensure inclusivity, such as avoiding gender-specific terms and including language that recognizes the diverse identities engaged in your event. 

You can find online examples of Glossaries developed by research funding bodies, or review the [NHS list of jargon and acronyms](https://www.nhsconfed.org/publications/acronym-buster) for inspiration.


### Using Plain Language

Similar to avoiding jargon, ensure that your core communications are written using Plain Language or are in an "easy reading" format. 

Using plain language is especially important in your registation and event information packs.

Plain language, sometimes refered to as Plain English in the UK and North America, allows for communications and other information to be read and understood easier. Consider how you will encourage attendees and speakers to adopt clear and plain language communication throughout your event. 

For example, you could address and encourage the use of plain language during the opening address or by signposting it in your event's shared information. You could also consider an activity where researchers are paired with non-researchers and are asked to explain their research in under 3 minutes. This can help to bring "clear and effective communication" to the forefront of attendee's minds and set all attendees up to communicate clearly throughout the event.

If possible, consider co-developing plain language and easy read content alongside a commnity representative or person with lived experience. If this is not possible for your event, ensure that core communications and event content is checked by using an external tool such as the [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/). You can also paste the URL of a website into a [Readability Checker](https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/) to check the content of your event's webpage. There are more resources below that can help you prepare Plain Language content. 

Aim to have all core event communications be understandable by a general audience, and written in Plain Language. This does not need to mean that your entire event is pitched to a general audience, however by making all general information understandable you will be more inclusive and more able to engage all potential attendees, from research staff, researchers, organzniers, people with lived experience, and other professions associated with your event's content. 

Using plain language for your communications can help all attendees understand and engage in your event. 

Additionally, consider how you will be mindful of, and review, language choices to ensure inclusivity. For example, as avoiding gender-specific terms and including language that recognizes diverse identities in your event information and content. This can help acknowledge and respect cultural differences of your attendees. 

#### Resources for Writing in Plain Language
The Office for National Statistics in the UK has [published a short guide on writing with Plain Langugage](https://service-manual.ons.gov.uk/content/writing-for-users/plain-language), and there are online tools such as the [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/) which gives you feedback on your writing to make it clearer. If you have a Microsoft Word account, there is also a feature (and [instructions on how to use it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-your-document-s-readability-and-level-statistics-85b4969e-e80a-4777-8dd3-f7fc3c8b3fd2?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us#__toc342546555)) which gives the reading level of your document's content.

#### Plain Language Summaries
If your event has a large focus on research content, consider writing plain language summaries of core content so that people with lived experience who do not have a background in research are able to engage in the sessions and understand the projects that are discussed. 

Please refer to [The Turing Way's chapter on Lay Summaries](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/lay-summaries.html) for more guidance and you can view good examples of plain language summaries from the [AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions research projects](https://aim-rsf.github.io/Glossary-of-Terms/pages/aim-projects.html). 


## Content Accessibility Guidance 

Ensuring that event communications, including printed content, is accessible to all attendees is critical...

Ensure that the designed material meets accessibility guidance: 
* **Use a size 14 (or larger) font** for both digital and printed content. A size 14 font is the reccomended size to make text information legible for a broad audience and support people with lived experience of visual impairments, and other conditions that affect readability.
* **Use a Sans Serif font** such as Arial, Helvetica, or Georgia. "Sans Serif" refers to fonts that do not have embellishments or lines on the letters. Using a Serif font such as Times New Roman can negatively impact readability and make it harder for people with dyslexia to read information. Using a Sans Serif font is especially important for online content such as emails and websites.
* **Use high contrast colours** in all content. For example, using dark text on a light background is considered best. If you are planning on using different colour palletes to create content and make communication more visually appealing, please ensure that your colours meet Accessibility Standards for Low Vision and Colour Blindness. You may want to consider giving speakers and presenters a guide on how to make their posters and presentations accessible if your event hosts a poster session.
* **Do not embed essential information in an image**. This includes the name, date, time and location of the event, and any accessibility information and using only PNG or JPEG file types. Images cannot be ‘read’ by screen readers that are being used by a person with a visual impairments. Consider using plain text for emails and providing flyers or images as attachements that are accompanied with Alternative Text Descriptions. 
* **Provide Alt-text** (Alternative Text) descriptions for online images in your content. This is helpful for people with visual impairments that use screen readers, and is also helpful for people with low bandwidth internet where images may not load on a page.
* **Use the styles tool** in text editors for headings. Font size by itself is not be detectable by screen readers, instead use the heading and title style tools in programs such as Microsoft Word, and GoogleDocs. 


A large part of inclusion is about building trust. Even if your email contains all the details that an image of your flyer does, a person who is unable to access the information in the image will not know if there is information they are missing out on. Try to use multiple channels (such as a pdf flyer with alt-text, plain text email, accessible website, and a captioned video) to duplicate the communication of core information and engage with the communities of people with lived experience to understand how to communicate best with them. 

You can find more information about other specific content considerations in a [blog post](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/) published by the Accessibility Team of the UK's Home Office Digital Group. These posters make reccomendations for how to make communications and information accessible for people with: 
- low vision
- D/deaf and hard of hearing
- dyslexia
- motor disabilities
- users on the autistic spectrum
- users of screen readers


### Working with Vendors 

As part of deciding what event and promotional materials will be required, identify who will develop these materials, whether it’s an external marketing agency or an internal graphic designer, and if there are additional requirements that vendors may have, such as specific printers, lead times, and file format preferences. 

This is especially important for in-person or hybrid events where you may be printing posters, flyers, or program books for the event. 

Vendors may not be able to print in certain colours which can undermine the efforts you have made to align with accessibility guidance. 

By checking this with a supplier, you will be able to adjust designs and content if anything goes wrong. 


### Using Hashtags
If you plan on developing a hashtag for your event, consider how you intend attendees to interact with the hashtag and for what purpose. A hashtag which aims to raise awareness of your event will be different from one that raises awareness of your organization and research area. Event specific hashtags can be useful to assess online engagement at your event, and can be used to develop awareness of your event if social media plays a large role in attracting atendees. 

If you do choose to use a hashtag, try using Pascal Case (somtimes called Title Case) #WhichLooksLikeThis, where the first letter in each word is capitalized. Using Lowercase and uppercase letters can benefit people with dyslexia, and can also help a screen reader identify separate words, allowing the technology to pronounce the hashtag correctly. 

Try to avoid using a hyphen in your hashtags which some social media sites will read as two separate words. If you can't keep your hashtag to a single work or phrase, use an underscore instead #Which_Looks_Like_This.

## What to Include 

This is not an exhaustive list, however it can be used as a reference in additional to the information above for what to include on a website or in an information pack. 


* Information about the event including: 
    * The Date and Time of the event.
    * Event Agenda or Program.
    * Location of event. Consider also sharing a map of the location and accompanying text instructions of the location and consider including details such as where parking would be available, where each of the session locations would be, and where to go in an emergency situation. 
    * Information about transport links and suggestions for how to get to the location from public transport.
    * Who is hosting the event and a point of contact. Consider including information about the hosts or supporting organization.

* Information about any Reimbursement or Honorarium Policies you may have. This includes details on: 
    * What can be reimbursed.
    * How to complete the process, as well as links to any forms that are needed. Consider writing a guide or instructions for any forms you may have. 
    * What is involved in the process.
    * Who to contact about reimbursements. When working with large research teams, it can become unclear who is responsible for what tasks. By detailing out what the reimbursement process will look like, and who to contact if there are questions, it can help make people with lived experience who take part in you event feel supported and understood and establishes a clear expectation. This is expecially important if the member of your event team who is the main point of contact for accessibility questions is different from the person able to process financial requests. 

* Information about who contact, and how to contact them regarding special requests such as:
    * The Event organiser. This may be the designated point of contact in an emergency.
    * A person who is able to provide Accessibility information and help if you are able to support it for your event. Try to make this contact available as soon as you announce the event, even if it is setting up a designated inbox.
    * Any Catering or dietary requirements. Because dietary requirements is protected information, not all members of an organizing team will have access to it anf be able to answer questions. 
    * Accommodation or transport logistics. This includes a point of contact for any hotels or customer support lines as well as a point of contact who can help secure bookings if needed, or to call if there is an issue (for example, a hotel being double booked or not providing step free access for wheelchair users).

* Sickness Policy:
    * The COVID-19 pandemic brought public health and safety back into active awareness for a large part of the population. It is reccomended to include a guidance or a policy in the event of an attendee becoming ill. To reduce community transmission and protect immunocompromised individuals, consider providing masks and requesting that any attendee who feels unwell attends the event online instead of in-person. COVID-19 and many other common illnesses can severely impact the health of people who may be immunocompromised, and it is important to consider how you will ensure the safety of attendees. You may have separate guidance for general sickness and for COVID, and can seek guidance from your local authority regarding health risk. 
    * This may also impact reimbursements for tickets or accomodation and travel depending on the insurance policy for your event.

* Emergency evacuation plans
    * As mentioned in [****] you may need to provide additional evacuation plans to your attendees. Please ensure that information about how, and where to evacuate to in the event of an emergency is provided to your attendees for reference. 

* Expected dress 
    * It can be helpful to surface tacit information, such as what to wear to an event, in your event information. Consider communicatting if there is an expectation of business, business casual, or any particular social events that then may require a different dress code (for example, closed toed shoes in a museum, or modest dress for a sacred site) and explain what that specific dress code means. You can include examples or reference images if it is particularly important to be dressed a certain way. For example research event that may be visited by a Royal Family or other dignitary. 
    * Where possible at your event, support the adoption of a casual dress code. Business or Formal wear can be cost prohibitve and inaccessible to those with mobility difficulties or sensory processing differences.

:::info
What to wear to research events can often differ greatly between fields. For example, some promient researchers and a Nobel Laurate have become known for not wearing shoes and avoiding formal wear at events. 

By making clear expectations and supporting people with lived experience attending your event, you are also helping make your event more inclusive and welcoming to all attendees in a non-judgemental space.

## At the Event

Consider how you will communicate with your attendees throughout the event. 

For example, relying solely on emails to send out information about a room change or delay in starting a session will mean that attendees require an active internet connection and smart device at all times. Many people may use their phones to join online events and not have a home computer. By over relying on emails, it would cause them to mean miss out on core communications. Similarly, for in-person events, people may not own a portable smart device capable of checking emails or online content. 

There are many different reasons for why you will want to communicate on the day of the event, for example to make attendants aware if there will be loud noises, videos, content that may trigger photosensitive epilepsy, or to update attendees when your event sessions start after a break. 

It is especially important to consider how you will communicate when there will be sensitive or potentially harmful content being shared. "Harmful" can be in the context mentioned above with photosensitive epilepsy, a response to discussion topics that may arrise, or a video that could be difficult or uncomfortable for attendees with sensory processing differences to experience. Consider communicating an overview of a session's content before it begins to allow attendees to prepare or choose to leave the session. 


:::info
Example: Below is a good example of proactive communication from a organization related to a service dog joining the office. It addresses both the accessibility requirement of person who will be accompanied by a service animal, and also opens a line of communication with an identified point of contact for anyone who may be impacted due to allergies or a fear of dogs. This message was shared by email and on a company intranet - the two most common places to recieve company communications, making it effective at reaching its staff and community.

```
Dear Community,
 
Please be aware that a member of staff will be using a service dog when they attend the office from next week. Please refrain from petting or interacting with the dog without the explicit consent of its owner. Many thanks for your cooperation.
 
If you have any allergies or require any adjustments, please contact the general facilities email address.

Consider what channels your attendees with lived experience recieve information from and try to match those in your event communications. For example, some attendees may need to be called on the phone to recieve information, or they may require a text instead of an email. 

With many cases, you may need to develop a strategy for how to ensure that all attendees are able to recieve event updated and plan for multimodal communication streams. 

## After the event 

Finally, once your event has finished, you may want to consider how you will engage with the attendees. 

This may involve sending out thank you's, a feedback survey, gift packs, or can be sending out closing event information such as links and slides for presentations, any summary notes, or other material that was delivered and able to be shared from the event. 

Depending on the size and format of your event, consider how you will communicate the timeline for when attendees can expect any follow up information. It may take a significant portion of time to manually transcribe sessions and add captions before uploading to a video hosting platform so it is helpful for attendees to know to expect follow up content.

This can be especially important if your event involves people with lived experience giving feedback or input into a project. It can be demoralizing for a person with lived experience to volunteer their time and expertise in a focus group or for a grant application, and then recieve no further information. Instead, consider setting a date where you or the research team will send an update, regardless of if a potential project gets funded or not. 


## Conclusion
By demonstrating an open channel of communication about accessibility, and by being thorough in your communications plans, you will be well positioned to support people with lived experience engaging in your event in a way that is safe and fulfiling.
