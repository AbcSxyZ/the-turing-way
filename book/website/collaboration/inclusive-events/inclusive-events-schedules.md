# Inclusive Event Schedules and Agenda
When developing a schedule or agenda for your event, it is important to reflect on how diferent aspects of an event's schedule will impact how inclusive and accessible your event will be.

As organizers, you should think critically about the timings and design of your event and and how to accommodate the diverse needs of your attendees. This can involve considerations ranging from planning sufficient breaks between sessions, to developing a plan for how to support the engagement and involvement of people with lived experience.

This section provides guidance and reccomendations for how to plan an inclusive and and accessible event schedule (or agenda) and highlights what steps you can take to create a welcoming atmosphere where attendees with lived experience feel heard and valued, and are able to equitable engage in your event.

It is crucial in your planning to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility in your event's scheduling and programming, and to recognize that the many of the traditional approaches to schedules and agendas may create barriers or be inaccessible to people with lived experience or disabilities. 


## Event Design: Timing and Event Duration
When developing your event's program or agenda, you should consider the timing of your event's content. This includes identifying when your event will start and end, the duration of your event's content and how you will structure the event content to make it accessible, and finally the duration of the event itself.

### Start and End Times
You may want to consider planning sessions and event start times around travel, for example by starting later in the day and finishing mid afternoon. This can help support attendes who need to travel to attend your event and may not be comfortable traveling at peak times. 
If your event needs to start early in the morning, consider hosting a welcome session that is able to be missed if necessary. 

Additionally, consider planning your event around important holidays and cultural celebrations. By considering when your attendees will be required elsewhere, you will be more likely to find a time that suits everyone. 

### Session Duration
Your schedule should take into account breaks, meal times, and carefully plan the length of its sessions. 

If your event takes place in person, make sure to allow for sufficient time for people with lived experience and mobility difficulties to move between locations. For example, consider how long it would take to get to an accessible elevator and then travel between floors, or how far away accessible restrooms are. If your main room has only one exit and a large audience, it may take significantly longer to exit the room and cause attendees stress as they have to rush between sessions. 

Additionally, many people who experience cognitive or physical fatigue find it difficult to actively engage in events that last longer than 40 minutes without a meaningful break. 

This timing can vary depending on individuals, however both ADHD advocates and people with a lived experience of cognitive impairements (such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and brain fog) have advocated for 30-40 minute session blocks for activities that require sustained attention and engagement. 

Try to plan for the most important parts of your event's content being shared within a blocks of time that are under 40 minutes.

Because many events plan in 1 hour or 1.5 hour timing blocks, consider choosing shorter sessions or incorporating breaks within your session. This can be  as well as and allowing for 5-10 minutes for an introduction and session set up. This can help reduce the cognitive strain that many people with lived experience of cognitive impairements are affected by. 

> **Example 1: 1 hour Focus Group Event**
    - 10 minute welcome, Code of Conduct, and Session introduction
    - 40 minute Discussion between participants
    - 10 minute break or 10 minute thank you and session close

> **Example 2: 1 hour Workshop event**
    - 5 minute introduction 
    - 20 minute session
    - 5 minute break
    - 20 minute session
    - 10 minute break or 10 minute thank you and session close

It is best to get feedback and input from a representative with lived experience when planning your session timings. This is because there may be diferences in what is required for a specific community that would negatively impact a different set of individuals. 

For example, if your event invites specifically people with lived experience of ADHD (and no other cognitive impairments) for a creative workshop. You may want to consider offering longer sessions that are facilitated with self-directed breaks. For example, for a 1.5hr event you may consider a 10 minute introducion, followed by a 50 minute self directed session, a 15 minute break, and then a 15 minute conclusion or share out and session close. This is because many people with a lived experience of ADHD can find that forced interruption is very disruptive and prohibitive of meaningful engagement on tasks that are creative or require deep focus.

### Event Duration
In addition to session length, it is also important to consider how your event will be structured to support the involvement and engagement of people with lived experience. 

If you are organizing a multi-day conference, consider picking either a single day or a repeating timeslot that features any content specifically important for people with lived experience. For example, Day 1 of a 3-Day event might schedule the majority of sessions focused on public engagement and lived experience, followed by Day 2 which could focus on technical workshops and other content. Alternatively, sessions from 10 - 1pm on all 3 days could focus on lived experience content. 

This can support the engagement of people with lived experience who volunteer their time to engage in research, as well as people with lived experience of disabilities and medication conditions that can significantly impact their energy levels. 


## Event Content: Planning for Engagement
When identifying the content of your event, you should spend time identifying what type of content and sessions will attendees with lived experience be interested in, what "engagement" means for your specific event, and how will you ensure that attendees with lived experience are able to engage in your event.

By clearly defining what engagement looks like, and also how to engage, your event will be make more accessible to people with lived experience and also reduce potential barriers and anxieties for participants.

### Defining Engagement for your Event
Providing guidance on what engagement means for your specific event can help to set expectations, and also reduce potential barriers and anxieties that attendees with lived experience may have when trying to engage in your event.  For example, people with an experience of cognitive impairment, as well as autistic people, can find unstructured sessions daunting which will negatively impact their ability to fully engage. 

The guidance you provide will be different depending on your event. For example, a public lecture may ask for attendees to show up and submit questions for the speaker at the end of the lecture. For this example, indicate in your guidance how long there will be for questions, how to use any online software you may be using to collect audience questions, and also how many questions you are likely going to answer. This can help avoid any feeling attendees may have about being ignored or not heard if their question is not addressed. 

For other events will require active participation such as a focus group or discussions, consider including guidance on the format discussions will have, and if there is any specific topics or prior material attendees should be familiar with in order to take part. Try to identify if your event will facilitate discussion between attendees, or if the sessions are to be chaired and led by a facilitator. By communicating to attendees that participaton is expected, and the specific format of participation, it can help allieviate worry or anxiety that attendees may have, and also set the session up for success. 

### Establishing Pathways for Engagement
People with lived experience may have varying comfort levels with public event, in additional to any disabilities that may have affected their ability to participate in other events. Consider providing explicit guidelines and options for engagement ensures that everyone can contribute at their own pace and in a manner that suits their preferences and needs. 

For example, a discussion or contribution based event may consider offering both spoken and written contributions. "Speaking" group(s) can be facilitated by a note taker, and the "Written" group(s) can work together in collaborative documents. You may also consider recording your event's content and making documents avalible online to support asynchronous contrbutions from people in multiple timezones or who may experience difficulties in contributing to "live" events. 

Consider designing sessions that support multiple channels of engagement to be as inclusive of as many accessibily requirements and preferences as possible. Because all events are limited by the resources avalible to plan and host the event, it is important to provide clear guidance on what engagement means for your event and to work with a representative with lived experience to identify what methods of engagement your event will need to support.

Ensure that you provide an outline of your guidance in both a written format prior to the event (preferably in plain text), and also include an explaination in your event introduction [of what engagement is expected, as well as the pathways avalible to contribute.]

### Sharing the Goals of your Event
Consider outlining and sharing a set of goals or planned outputs from your event with your audience when you begin a session. For example, a workshop may present learning objectives or an example of the planned finished product. 

By clearly articulating the event's objectives, you will be able to create a sense of transparency and purpose to the session. This clarity allows all attendees, including people with lived experience, to understand what to expect from the session and reflexivly evaluate whether their participation aligns with those goals. 

Additionally, sharing an event's goals can foster a sense of trust among attendees by presrnting how the perspectives and contributions of people with lived experience are valued by the research project team. This can be especially important for "data driven" research that otherwise places a large focus on algorithmic techniques. 

Inclusive research requires not only active participation from people with lived expereince and diverse backgrounds, but also actively ensuring that their opinions and perspectives are heard and able to influence the research directly. Through orientating your attendees around a goal, you can provide a shared understanding that will support the meaningful and inclusive engagement in your event.


### Planning for Inclusion
As part of planning the program, consider how you will support and facilitate relationship building and the active inclusion of people with lived experience in your event's sessions.

Research events can often be focused on actively engaging researchers who have a clear pathway to engagement and involvement in an event, for example explaining their research or asking questions of colleagues to better understand what research methods led to a new discovery. If your event plans to involve people with lived experience, you should consider designing your event's sessions to allow for experts through experience to engage in the material equitably alonside any attendees who are experts by profession, instead of being segragated out for being "non-researchers". 

```{note}
Mozilla has developed a framework called [ADIDS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k6Sft7YH2QrDzqzE6TZhociWVjXe7rLMDjAJ734qNKA/edit#slide=id.g1cd292f458d_0_19) that can help event organizers plan sessions that actively engage and involve a diverse audience. You can read more about ADIDS on the [MozFest website](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/facilitator-guide/designing-a-successful-session/), or by working through the framework for your own event.
```

### Building Rapport with Event Design
The active involvement of people with lived experience in incredibly important because it enables the design and delivery of research and outputs that is informed by lived experienve, and better reflects the needs of the communities that stand to benefit the most from research interventions.

You can encourage inclusive participation from people with lived experience by making use of inclusive and "unconventional" approaches in your event. For example, consider brokering conversation between attendees in a "World Cafe". 

World Cafes bring rotating tables (virtual or physical) of people with differing expertise together to engage in evolving rounds of dialogue on a specific topic. The smaller grouping allows for more conversation between people and can be less daunting for people with lived experience to engage in. You can read more about the World Cafe method on [The World Café Community Foundation's blog](https://theworldcafe.com/key-concepts-resources/world-cafe-method/). 


### The role of Moderators and Facilitators
Facilitators and session moderators can help to foster a safe and supportive environment for people with lived experience to share their perspectives and insight. Their role at an inclusive event is to provide safe and supported opportunities for active participation from attendees, act as a catalyst for conversation, and to help align discussion and any questions with the goals of the session and event. 

If you are able to involve facilitators or moderators at your event, consider how they can support the engagement and contributions from people with lived experience. This is especially important for events that focus on discussion or require active participation (such as the World Cafes we discussed in the previous section). Many people with lived experience may not have recieved formal training on public speaking or rhetoric and can be at a greater risk of being left out of conversation. 

Just inviting people with lived experience to your event is not sufficient if they are not supported and actively welcomed to engage in your event's content. 

Although it is becoming more common for people with lived experience to become self advocates and recieve training in public speaking, it is important for researchers and event organizers to consider and make use of moderators and session facilitators to uphold inclusive and equitable engagement practice. 

### Using Icebreakers and Teambuilding
Additionally, you may consider using a collaborative activity to open your session such as an ice breaker or other team building task. This can help build rapport among event attendees, and orientate everyone towards a shared goal before the formal parts if your session begin.

By establishing an active partnership between people with lived experience, researchers, and other experts by profession in your event's sessions, you will be well positioned to support an eqitable space for all attendees to meaningfully engage with your event.


## Including People with Lived Experience in Session Planning / Creating an Inclusive Program

[See PR - section content WIP]



### Session Schedule
When planning your event's content schedule, reflect back on the purpose of your event, who your attendees are going to be, and why they will be attending your event. This can help to narrow down and decide on key event content and ensure that there is a balance of topics that are diverse enough to appeal to a range of attendees. 

At larger events, it may not be possible to develop a full schedule that is inclusive of a general audience or people with lived experience. In this instance, event organizers should consider both how this will be communicated to people with lived experience in attendance, and also what alternative arrangements will be offered to support attendees with lived experience.

```{note}
Event organizers should not assume that "people with lived experience" is synonymous with "general public" as many people with lived experience of disabilities or medical conditions are experts in their profession as well as in their experience. However, if your event is designed to be inclusive of a group of people with a specific lived experience, it is important to involve them in the event planning in order to identify and get feedback on session planning. 
```

### Including Diverse Speakers
When identifying sessions or speakers for your event, it is incredible important to include a person with lived experience in your speaker list or panelists. 

By supporting and promoting a representative with lived experience at your event, you will actively foster an  inclusive environment by providing a platform for those who have lived through similar experiences to share their perspectives, insights, and expertise thus creating a more relatable and empathetic environment for all attendees. 

These speakers may share perspectives that resonates deeply with an audience, and can be the catalyst attendees with lived experience to understand that their perspectives and experiences are valued.

This core idea around representation can help to establish a shared space between attendees where it feels safe and supportive to engage in a dialogue about lived experience. The presence of, and promotion of these speakers validates and legitimizes the significance of personal experiences within research, and can faciliate a more inclusive and nuanced discourse at your event.

Additionally, people with lived experience can offer practical, real-world insights that might not be captured solely through academic or research-based perspectives. By hosting sessions delivered or facilitated by people with lived experience, all attendees will be able to engage with and better understand what "lived experience" means for a specific person or group. This is important because even in research projects that involve participatory methods, not all researchers have the opportunity to directly engage with the people with lived experience involved in the project. Having a speaker or session lead present from a place of lived experience can give all attendees the opportunity to learn and engage with the process of participatory research as a whole, and ensures that researchers, research staff, and other professionals will develop a more comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and challenges faced by people with lived experience. 

This may also have the added benefit of improving the research conducted by attendees, or influence project design in the future. 

Many research conferences and events provide opportunities for discussion and the learning of different research skills and practices. Lived experience speakers can complement and enrich research insights, and offer a more holistic and authentic understanding of different contexts and experiences. 

Including and highlighting speakers or session leads with lived experience and offering a diverse range of voices both broadens the scope of representation, and helps to prevents assumptions and stereotypes about people with lived experience which can help to empower other attendees with lived experience to become more actively involved in research.
 

### Providing Event Descriptions
Consider including a description of your intended audience and any expertise requirements to your session information. Ensure that these session descriptions, the program, and any organisational information are written in using Plain Language. 

Include session descriptions in the program of events. This description should include:
- a short and clear title of the session or event
- the name of any hosts, facilitators, or moderators
- a short abstract about what the session is 
- information about what level of engagement is expected in the session
- details on who the intended attendees are for the session
- any additional information such as location, start time, and Zoom links if applicable

> For example:
> **AI approaches and methodologies across AIM**
> **Description:** A roundtable discussion to map the different applications of AI methods across AIM investments with a goal of identifying similarities and articulating nuanced differences across AIM consortia projects. Pens and paper will be provided. This session will involve active discussion between small groups of attendees that will rotate every 15 minutes.
> **Facilitators:** Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, Katherine Johnson
> **Audience:** Technical leads, statisticians, data intensive researchers across the AIM consortia
> **Time:** 14.00 - 15.30. Comfort break from 14:45 - 15.00. 
> **Location:** The Great Hall, Hogwarts.

### Using Parallel Sessions
Conferences and other large events can often bring together a wide range of attendees with an equally wide range of experiences and expertise. For these events, it may not be ideal to curate all content and sessions suitable for a general audience. However, in this case it is very important that organizers clearly communicate about the content of sessions, and that sessions are labeled appropriately on all promotional material. 

Consider if you are able to run "parallel" tracks or sessions and dedicate one of these tracks to sessions that would be of interest to people with lived experience. 

Ensure that your sessions which focus on people's lived experience, and any research methods which actively involve members of the public are able to be attended by researchers and other professionals in attendance. 

It can be a "*convenient*" strategy to plan a general audience session as an alternative option for people with lived experience to attend, which will occur at the same time as a highly technical session that would be of interest to researchers or attendees with a background in quantitative science. This can lead to a segregation between people with lived experience and their research colleagues which results in a knowledge and involvement disparity. It is important to give researchers the opportunity to attend sessions and events that focus on lived experience and public involvement. 

Consider running any highly technical sessions in parallel with coffee breaks or networking, and then highlighting that researchers and attendees with a technical background are welcome and encouraged to attend sessions with a lived experience focus. 


### Creating a Program: Session Type
Different session formats may help or hinder the engagement and participation of people with lived experience in your event. For example, panel discussions, workshops, and interactive sessions, will all present different barriers and levels of support depending on the specific needs of your attendees. 

Consider using a mix of oral presentations, panel discussions, videos, workshops and breakout sessions, as well as using supporting different methods of interaction in order to support attendees with lived experience. By providing varies content types, you will be more likely to support a wider range of needs and preferences and ensure that there is an option avalible for your attendees with lived experience to engage with/in.

Ensure that you actively label and communicate what the session formats will be. This will allow attendees to self select the sessions and event content that they feel most comfortable engaging with. 

If your event can only support one type of format, consider asking for input and feedback from either your community or a representative with lived experience. This will ensure that you choose the format option which will support your specific community of people with lived experience best. 


## Conclusion
Taking the time to carefully consider your event's schedule and content will ensure all attendees feel valued and are able to engage in your event.

By designing a schedule that provides flexibility around breaks and the types of engagement, offers a variety of session formats that are clearly communicated, and also by includes speakers from different backgrounds, your event will be able to effectively support a community of people with lived experience.
