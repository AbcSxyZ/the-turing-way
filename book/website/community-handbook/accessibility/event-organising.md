# Access-centered support for events

The Turing Way hosts a variety of ongoing community calls throughout the year: virtual Collaboration Cafes, coworking calls, and onboarding sessions (which are being trialed in 2024). 

All of The Turing Way community calls are hosted on either a remote-first and/or hybrid-basis. 

In order to enable the widest participation possible, and overcome any possible barriers that may prevent despite any barriers that participants may experience, we aim to provide the following support for each call.

All of The Turing Way community calls adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

##Â Access and inclusion-related support we provide for virtual events

For calls like our coworking calls and Collaboration Cafes, these are built into the pomodoro working format, with a variety of optional and gently-enforced breaks to ensure. For our trainings, workshops and onboarding sessions, we make sure build in breaks on a context-specific basis.  

2. **Co-hosting**: Workshops and trainings are co-hosted by default in order to ensure ease of , as well as provide support to answer additional questions or IT issues. 

3. **Reference material**: Before each call, we aim to share slides, links and other reference materials to ensure that that the material can be referenced before or during the call. After each call. Many of our community materials and presentations are uploaded to our [Zenodo community page](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-turing-way/), and licensed CC-BY for use by others. 

4. **Transcription**: Our calls are hosted on the Zoom platform, and as a community we use the built-in zoom transcription feature. Due to IT limitations from our hosting organisation, we do not currently use any additional transcription support (such as Otter.ai), but hope to do so in the future.

5. **Recordings**: Community calls like the coworking call and collaboration cafes are not recorded by default, though the notes from each session are uploaded in our repository.

6. Alternative forms of engagement: We tend to be a video-on. However, that'
