# Accessibility

Within The Turing Way community, we define accessibility practices as a set of community-wide, behavioral, social, and technical decisions that can be taken to ensure that all are welcome and are able to enter and participate in research and data-driven processes, communities and events despite access as it relates to language, disability, and geography. 

While accessibility is commonly understood with respect to disability, we – meaning The Turing Way community – define accessibility as giving access to groups of people that encounter different barriers for participation, and in this sense, our accessibility practices may overlap with practices that enable inclusion. Examples of this may include the language used to communicate within a team (be that an international and/or interdisciplinary environment), access to computing infrastructure or institutional resoures, internet connectivity needs, hiring and facilitating diverse teams, and more. 

We aim to draw from the [access-centered framework](https://accesscenteredmovement.com/what-access-centered-means/) in describing access as a constant process that changes in each space with each individual. Therefore, this policy focuses both on accessibility as it relates to disabled people as well as practices that enable broader participation in and contribution to The Turing Way book project as well as the wider community. 

This means that questions of access are tied to how people read the guides as well as their ability to participate the project and the community more broadly. Doing so requires navigating a number of different platforms (such as Github, Slack, and others) and languages that may be (beyond English – which is the default language of _The Turing Way_ community, as well as scientific research more broadly). In each of these practices, we aim to facilitate access in a broad sense.

Much like how _The Turing Way_ itself is always being written and rewritten, our accessibility and access-related practices are constantly being updated as broader awareness grows and changes in technology are made.
