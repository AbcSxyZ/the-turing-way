# Navigating the Handbook

Our moonshot goal is to make reproducibility "too easy not to do".

All resources shared in this book have been developed with a purpose to advance reproducible, ethical and collaborative practices in research and data science worldwide.

We are deeply committed to openness, inclusivity, ethical conduct and access in data science and AI, and have integrated these aspects across all our resources and the work we do.

## Structure of the Handbook

_The Turing Way_ handbook is organised in five guides and a Community Handbook.

### _The Turing Way_ Guides

Each guide contains multiple chapters, and each chapters are divided into smaller, self-contained sub-chapters to allow you to navigate the book and its content easily in your own pace.

## Areas of Work and Scope

_The Turing Way_ is continually evolving to meet the needs and interests of the community across following areas of work.

1. Engage diverse stakeholders in _The Turing Way_ through open, inclusive and collaborative efforts, **fostering a community** that collectively shapes research and scientific discourse in data science and AI.
2. Co-create, maintain, and sustain an open-source, **community-driven handbook** on data science, providing tools, practices and real-world examples of **open and reproducible research**.
3. Advocate for **responsible and ethical practices**, promoting transparency, fostering accountability and embedding human rights principles throughout the lifecycle of research, data science and AI projects. 
4. Champion best practices in **communication, collaboration, and project design** as fundamental pillars for making data science and AI accessible, comprehensible, and beneficial for all stakeholders.

### Scope of _The Turing Way_

The scope of _The Turing Way_ can be broadly described across six areas of work, with practices and resources shared openly in the handbook:

1. **_The Turing Way_ Book:** Disseminating best practices, examples, and recommendations openly in chapters covering reproducible research, communication, collaboration, project design, ethics, and community.
2. **_The Turing Way_ Community:** Fostering a diverse and international community, encouraging contributions, building upon existing knowledge, and collaboratively advancing best practices in data science.
3. **Open Leadership:** Promoting open leadership by providing community infrastructure, processes, and resources for individuals from diverse backgrounds and interests to lead and connect a decentralised network of actors and their efforts.
4. **Domain Expertise:** Collaborating with representatives and experts who contextualise and share _The Turing Way_ resources in their respective domains.
5. **Project Partnership:** Proactively partnering with organisations and projects aligned with our vision and mission, combining knowledge, expertise, and resources for the shared benefits of our communities.
6. **Global Impact:** Extending the impact of _The Turing Way_ by conducting global outreach, engaging with different sectors, supporting the localisation of resources, advocating for policy changes and facilitating cross-community efforts
