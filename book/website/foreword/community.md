# Community and Roles

The _The Turing Way_ handbook is collaboratively written and open from the start.
The handbook maybe the visible product of the work we do in the project, but, the process of collaborative development with the help of its community is what we value the most.
This project can simply not exist without the collaborative nature of this project and the willingness of our community members to support each other.
We are committed to providing an open, accessible and inclusive space for all our community members where they are appreciated, upskilled and given opportunities to contribute to the project in a way that is most meaningful for them.

## Contributors

*Everyone has a skill that is useful for someone, and therefore anyone can contribute to _The Turing Way_.*

We encourage and support everyone in _The Turing Way_ to collaborate on shared ideas and resources, co-develop chapters, review and improve existing materials and share them with the wider research community.
Through this process, our contributors build new connections and build a sense of belonging and shared-ownership in the project.

## Opportunities for Community Members

Community members are provided with opportunities to learn new skills, share their ideas and collaborate with others. 
They are also given mentorship opportunities in the project as they make their contributions to The Turing Way or other open source projects and are encouraged to mentor new participants of the project.

To make this project truly accessible and useful for everyone, we invite you to contribute your skills and bring your perspectives into this project.
To join this community, please read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and ways to [get in touch](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#get-in-touch).
More information about the community and the project is available in the {ref}`ch`.
We look forward to expanding and building _The Turing Way_ together.

## Represent _The Turing Way_

We have created a [promotion pack](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/communications/promotion-pack) to help you in presenting and sharing about The Turing Way in your network.

_The Turing Way_ team will be happy to provide help in delivering a talk by providing training or feedback.
Please email [theturingway@gmail.com](mailto:theturingway@gmail.com) to set 1:1 meeting.
