# Community and Roles

Everyone has a skill that is useful for someone, and therefore anyone can contribute to _The Turing Way_.

Long-term and sustained contributors of the project are considered part of the core contributors groups who take on various leadership roles in the project.
Please read  to learn about how we acknowledge your work and how our contributors are {ref}`highlighted in the project<ch-acknowledgement-record>`

Community members are provided with opportunities to learn new skills, share their ideas and collaborate with others. 
They are also given mentorship opportunities in the project as they make their contributions to The Turing Way or other open source projects and are encouraged to mentor new participants of the project.

The Online Book is the visible product of the work we do in the project, but, the process of collaborative development with the help of its community is what we value the most.
The backbone of this process lies in supporting its community by providing an open, accessible and inclusive space where they are appreciated, upskilled and given opportunities to contribute to the project in a way that is most meaningful for them.
In turn, these members support each other in the community, collaborate on mutually beneficial ideas and resources, co-develop chapters, review and improve existing materials, share them with the wider community, make new connections and develop a sense of belonging and shared-ownership in the project.

The book is collaboratively written and open from the start.
To make this project truly accessible and useful for everyone, we invite you to contribute your skills and bring your perspectives into this project.
To join this community, please read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and ways to [get in touch](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#get-in-touch).
More information about the community and the project is available in the {ref}`ch`.
We look forward to expanding and building _The Turing Way_ together.
