# _The Turing Way_ Community

_The Turing Way_ ([https://the-turing-way.netlify.app](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app)) is an open-source, collaborative, and community-driven project focused on data science and research reproducibility.
The project encompasses a handbook in data science with five guides developed by a diverse community of contributors from various sectors.
_The Turing Way_ has been co-authored by more than 450+ (as of June 2024) contributors and is utilised by a broad community of contributors, collaborators, and learners from academia, industry, and government.

This community is dedicated to sharing and facilitating research best practices, tools, and infrastructure.
The project is managed by the project delivery team, which includes two project leads, a research project manager, and a research community manager within The Alan Turing Institute's Tools, Practices, and Systems Research Programme.
The governance body of _The Turing Way_ is represented by the project delivery team and volunteers from the community who lead various formal and informal initiatives.
All contributions, discussions, and contributor details are handled through the central GitHub repository ([https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/)). 
Contributors' details are available in the [Contributors Records](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html%C2%A0), and the [project summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LzSWfLPk2uxC9YrVg61H4FgfiHvGCnhTBX-kTGZ1Er4/edit#) from 2022 offers a comprehensive overview of recent outcomes and impacts.

## Vision, Mission and Scope

**Moonshot Goal:** Make reproducibility too easy not to do.

**Vision:** Embed reproducible, ethical and collaborative practices in research and data science worldwide.

**Missions:** Our missions serve as a strategic framework for operationalising our vision and acting on our commitment to openness, inclusivity, ethical conduct and access in data science and AI. 

1. Engage diverse stakeholders in _The Turing Way_ through open, inclusive and collaborative efforts, **fostering a community** that collectively shapes research and scientific discourse in data science and AI.
2. Co-create, maintain, and sustain an open-source, **community-driven handbook** on data science, providing tools, practices and real-world examples of **open and reproducible research**.
3. Advocate for **responsible and ethical practices**, promoting transparency, fostering accountability and embedding human rights principles throughout the lifecycle of research, data science and AI projects. 
4. Champion best practices in **communication, collaboration, and project design** as fundamental pillars for making data science and AI accessible, comprehensible, and beneficial for all stakeholders.

**Scope of _The Turing Way_ Project**

_The Turing Way_ is continually evolving, adapting to the needs and interests of the community. As of December 2023, the scope of _The Turing Way_ can be described under six areas of work:

1. **_The Turing Way_ Book:** Disseminating best practices, examples, and recommendations openly in chapters covering reproducible research, communication, collaboration, project design, ethics, and community.
2. **_The Turing Way_ Community:** Fostering a diverse and international community, encouraging contributions, building upon existing knowledge, and collaboratively advancing best practices in data science.
3. **Open Leadership:** Promoting open leadership by providing community infrastructure, processes, and resources for individuals from diverse backgrounds and interests to lead and connect a decentralised network of actors and their efforts.
4. **Domain Expertise:** Collaborating with representatives and experts who contextualise and share _The Turing Way_ resources in their respective domains.
5. **Project Partnership:** Proactively partnering with organisations and projects aligned with our vision and mission, combining knowledge, expertise, and resources for the shared benefits of our communities.
6. **Global Impact:** Extending the impact of _The Turing Way_ by conducting global outreach, engaging with different sectors, supporting the localisation of resources, advocating for policy changes and facilitating cross-community efforts

**Get Involved:** If you have ideas and plans for _The Turing Way_ that fall outside the scope listed above, please reach out to _The Turing Way_ team via email at [turingway@turing.ac.uk](mailto:turingway@turing.ac.uk). Your input is valuable to the ongoing development of the project.
