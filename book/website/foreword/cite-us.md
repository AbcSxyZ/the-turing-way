# Citing _The Turing Way_

All material in _The Turing Way_ is available under a [CC-BY 4.0 licence](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

You can cite _The Turing Way_ through the project's Zenodo archive using DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.3233853](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233853).

The citation will look something like:

>  The Turing Way Community, Becky Arnold, Louise Bowler, Sarah Gibson, Patricia Herterich, Rosie Higman, â€¦ Kirstie Whitaker. (2019, March 25). The Turing Way: A Handbook for Reproducible Data Science (Version v0.0.4). Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233986

Please visit the [DOI link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233853) though to get the most recent version - the one above is not automatically generated and may be out of date.
DOIs allow us to archive the repository and are useful for tracking the work in academic publications.

You can also share the human-readable URL to a page in the book, for example, {ref}`definitions chapter in the Guide for Reproducible Research<rr-overview-definitions>`, but be aware that the project is under development and these links may change over time.
You might want to include a [web archive link](http://web.archive.org), such as [an archived page for definitions chapter](https://web.archive.org/web/20191030093753/https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/reproducibility/03/definitions.html), to make sure that you do not end up with broken links everywhere!

We really appreciate any references that you make to The Turing Way project in your and we hope it is useful. 
If you have any questions please get in touch.

The Turing Way illustrations are created by artists from Scriberia as part of The Turing Way book dashes since 2019.    
They depict a variety of content from the handbook, collaborative efforts in the community and The Turing Way project in general. 
These illustrations are available on Zenodo [10.5281/zenodo.3332807](10.5281/zenodo.3332807) under a CC-BY license.

When using any of the images, please include the following attribution:
