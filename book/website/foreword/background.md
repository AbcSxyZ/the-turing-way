# Background

Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted. Funders and publishers are beginning to require that publications include access to the underlying data and the analysis code. 
The goal is to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work. 
This is sometimes easier said than done. 
Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers and data scientists.
Furthermore, 'technical skill' alone is not sufficient for making research reproducible and open for all.

_The Turing Way_ provides resources to build an understanding of good practices and improve research habits through modular chapters in a self-contained handbook.
Lessons learned through _The Turing Way_ series of guides will help design projects with reproducible, collaborative and ethical research frameworks. 
It will also ensure that PhD students, postdocs, PIs and funding teams know which parts of the "responsibility of reproducibility" they can affect, and what they should do to nudge research and data science to be more efficient, effective and understandable.

The book started in January 2019 as a guide for reproducibility, covering {ref}`rr-vcs`, {ref}`rr-testing`, and {ref}`rr-ci`. However, technical skills are just one aspect of making data science research "open for all" and so in February 2020, _The Turing Way_ expanded into a series of guides: {ref}`rr`, {ref}`pd`, {ref}`cm`, {ref}`cl`, and {ref}`er`.

The project has always been developed openly and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are always welcome at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
