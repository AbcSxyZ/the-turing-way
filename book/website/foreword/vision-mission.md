# Vision and Mission

*This document is a draft to help guide the governance planning in the project.*

The Turing Way is an online handbook – and global community – dedicated to fostering gold-standard reproducible research. 
It’s a cultural movement with the potential to transform data science.

We involve and support a diverse community of contributors to make data science accessible, comprehensible and effective for everyone.
Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers and data scientists in academia, industry and the public sector need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.

***Our moonshot goal is to make reproducibility too easy not to do!***
