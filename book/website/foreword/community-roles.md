# Community Roles and Pathways for Collaboration

_Everyone has a skill that is useful for someone, and therefore anyone can contribute to The Turing Way._

You can participate in _The Turing Way_ through several community roles, including those related to book authorship and emergent roles for trainers, presenters, and speakers, from which the broader community can learn and benefit.

_The Turing Way_ project also involves collaborators from projects within the Turing, partnering organisations, open-source communities, and beyond, either formally through funded grant proposals or informally through collaborative activities such as co-creation of resources (such as chapters, articles or community documentation) and events (such as Fireside Chat, Book Dash and external conference session).
In this document, we describe these roles to guide you, our community members, in identifying the best routes for their involvement in the project and our community.

Irrespective of how deeply one would like to engage in _The Turing Way_, we create opportunities for community participation, skill building and pathways to leadership in data science.
By involving participants from all around the world, we learn about and create new opportunities to share data skills and practices from global contexts.

By enabling the collaboration of users and contributors with each other, we ensure that the project, community and resources represent, amplify and broaden the reach of global voices in data science.
We describe the contributing process in the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

```{admonition} Reminder
Participation in _The Turing Way_ doesn’t only involve contributions to the Book.
```

From the onset, the project staff team have worked to define different pathways for engagement and acknowledgement processes in _The Turing Way_, ensuring that all roles are recognised and valued in _The Turing Way_.
You can read the details in our community handbook in the [acknowledging contributors](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/acknowledgement) chapter.

## The Turing Way Book and community-related roles

_The Turing Way_ book is collaboratively written and open from the start.
We encourage and support everyone in _The Turing Way_ to collaborate on shared ideas and resources, co-develop chapters, review and improve existing materials and share them with the wider research community.
Through this process, our contributors provide support for each other, establish new connections and build a sense of belonging and shared ownership in the project.

To make this project truly accessible and useful for everyone, we invite members of our community to contribute their skills and bring new perspectives through the development of the book.
_The Turing Way_ roles for chapter writing include:

* **Co-authors**: Co-authors collaborate on writing, editing, revising, or adding/replacing relevant sections of a chapter in _The Turing Way_ book, while following the {ref}`ch-style`.
* **Reviewer**: Reviewers critically review existing and new content of The Turing Way book, providing feedback, suggesting edits, and enhancing the accessibility, accuracy, and quality of the material.
* **Editors**: Editors oversee the overall coverage, coherence, and consistency of a chapter or a guide, or even the structure of _The Turing Way_ book at a meta level and document the current status and areas for improvement in a GitHub issue. They may not be the same people who address those issues, but they can be involved in coordinating contributions from authors and reviewers from the community.
* **Mentors**: Mentors guide less experienced contributors, offering advice and support to help them clarify concepts, unpack their thoughts and ideas, and provide direction to ensure that new members can effectively participate in the development of _The Turing Way_ book.
* **Advisory roles**: Individuals in advisory roles provide strategic guidance and expertise in the context of the book, community, or the overall project, helping to shape the direction and scope of _The Turing Way_.

The book or authorship-related roles vary based on people’s involvement in developing content in _The Turing Way_ guides at different times such as chapters, subchapters, impact stories, personal stories, case studies and templates
Reviewers are often drawn from the community, based on their experience in the chapter’s topic.
Often reviewers are also invited from beyond the community to ensure new members have the chance to collaborate based on their expertise.

Existing members of the community are connected with new contributors for supporting and mentoring their contributions, such as helping navigate _The Turing Way_ repository, workflow, writing process or even reviewing. 
Contributions also include providing advisory support, such as by sharing examples, resources or other relevant resources that could be helpful for the authors.

## Beyond the Book

The book may be the visible product of the work we do in the project, but, the process of collaborative development with the help of its community is what we value the most.
This project can simply not exist without the collaborative nature of this project and the willingness of our community members to support each other.
We are committed to providing an open, accessible and inclusive space for all our community members where they are appreciated, upskilled and given opportunities to contribute to the project in a way that is most meaningful for them.

Roles beyond the book can involve, but are not limited to the following:

* **Reviewers and maintainers** of the book and underlying infrastructure
* **Advocate and champions **of _The Turing Way_ resources, who help others navigate the book, repositories and communications channel
* **Creators** of content and infrastructure at any level from fixing bugs to adding new content beyond the book
* **Mentors and consultants** in specific areas of work, including responding to questions from other community members on GitHub and Slack
* **Sustained contributors** who provide expert consultation to improve the resources
* Members providing support through** in-kind collaboration/partnership**
* **Connector, convener and collaborators** from the broader data science network
* **_The Turing Way_ curious** (‘lurkers’) users of resources who read, adopt and share best practices from _The Turing Way_ in their work and participate in public events/communications channel
* **Your personal experience** (that we value a lot!) will enrich _The Turing Way_ resources with real-world contexts

New contributors to _The Turing Way_ can begin their journey at any time, and through various pathways including voluntary participation, invited contribution, training/workshop-based introduction, organisational collaboration, and personal collaboration with other community members or others.
Our general recommendations for any new starters are the following:

* Start small! Find easy wins!
* Start with what they don’t know and want to learn.
* Start with what they know and want to share.
* Capture the process of how they work in their projects and _The Turing Way_
* They share their personal stories, case studies and perspective: _The Turing Way_ is a ‘lightly’ opinionated guide after all!

### Represent _The Turing Way_

We have a chapter on {ref}`ch-presenting` to help you present and share about _The Turing Way_ in your network.

_The Turing Way_ team will be happy to discuss your ideas with you, provide feedback and any other assistance you need for delivering a talk.

### Learn and Share Skills

Community members are provided with opportunities to learn new skills, share their ideas and collaborate with others. 
They are also given mentorship opportunities in the project as they make their contributions to _The Turing Way_ or other open source projects and are encouraged to mentor new participants of the project. 

Community members have been taking roles like trainers, workshop leads, translators, infrastructure maintenance, accessibility experts, representatives of different projects in _The Turing Way_ and advocates of different topics of _The Turing Way_'s interest in external projects.
Some of these areas of work have recently been formalised and are also being led by volunteer members (see Governance Roles).
For instance, _The Turing Way_ team and community members have been workshops from the very beginning.
Some of these workshops has become part of regular events and conferences to introduce _The Turing Way_ resources and data science practices among a new audience and early career researcher groups. 

Delivery of these workshops includes the following roles:

* **Expert facilitators and trainers** of Open Science, Reproducibility and ethics-related workshops, both organised by _The Turing Way_ and delivered in external events
* **Technical trainer** for novice learners on tools like GitHub, Binder, Jupyter and Literate Programming 
* **Presenters and speakers** for international events/conferences who represent _The Turing Way_ in external platforms

All members are supported to structure their work in _The Turing Way_ to make them findable and onboard new members in their work to provide continuity of their work.
Researchers are also supported to lead community-based discussions and collaborations, that lead to projects and outputs beyond _The Turing Way_.
