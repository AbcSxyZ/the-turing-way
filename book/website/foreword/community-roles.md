# Community and Community Roles

_Everyone has a skill that is useful for someone, and therefore anyone can contribute to The Turing Way._

_The Turing Way_ book has been co-authored by more than 450+  contributors and utilised by diverse groups of individuals who are researchers, educators, learners, policymakers, government employees and industry professionals.

As of June 2024, _The Turing Way_ community has been joined by more than 1000 members, who engage via GitHub, Slack Workspace and a range of community events.
The book itself has 6000+ monthly users from worldwide.

All contributions, discussions, and contributor details are handled through the central GitHub repository ([https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/)). 
Contributors' details are available in the [Contributors Records](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html%C2%A0), and the [project reports](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/project_management/quarterly_reports) offer detailed updates from different areas of work within _The Turing Way_.

## Project Delivery Team

The project is managed by the project delivery team, which includes two project leads, a research project manager, and a research community manager, funded by The Alan Turing Institute's Tools, Practices, and Systems Research Programme.

## Governance

The governance body of _The Turing Way_ is represented by the project leadership and volunteer community leaders from the community who are involves in various formal and informal initiatives.

```{admonition} Definition
Governance is a set of formal and informal practices through which an organisation sets goals, assigns responsibilities, establishes systems, and assesses outcomes of organisational action.
```

### Three Level of Decision Making

In 2023-2024, _The Turing Way_ adopted three institutional "levels", originally described in the context of Studies of the institutional design of natural resource commons, to describe three broad levels of formal and informal norms that affects decision making {cite}`Schweik2007commons`, {cite}`Ostrom2005commons`.

1. The “Community level" ("Operational-level”) norms that influence the everyday decisions and actions made by project participants such in using, participating in and contributing to a project.
2. The "Maintenance" (“Collective choice") norms that allow sharing authority with different groups of people who can conduct and promote collective work in the project as well as define/change rules for operational level participation and procedures to follow to make such a change. 
3. The "Constitutional-level" norms specifying who is allowed to change collective choice rules and the procedures for making such changes.

Each level of decision-making norms should inform and influence each other through governance processes that enable transparency in the system through regular and open interactions.

Below, we describe these three levels of decision making in the context of _The Turing Way_, inputs for which were invited from open discussions with our community members ([follow Miro board for details](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMnA6G50=/?share_link_id=810801549803)).
This model was presented in a Community Forum in February 2024, recording for which is shared below.

Irrespective of how deeply one would like to engage in _The Turing Way_, we have created roles and opportunities for participation, skill building and pathways to leadership.
We discuss these roles and opportunities, so that you can identify the best level of engagement for yourself in the project and our community.

We want to ensure that all roles are recognised and valued in _The Turing Way_.
Therefore, from the onset, we have worked to define these different paths for engagement, support and acknowledgement for community members in _The Turing Way_.
You can read the details in our community handbook in the [acknowledging contributors](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/acknowledgement) chapter.

### 1. Community Level (short overview)

This level encompasses all members of *The Turing Way* community, both longstanding and new.
Members may have made contributions to the book, participated in an event or simply engaged as book users, social media followers, Slack Workspace members or as independent advocates of _The Turing Way_.

```{admonition} Reminder
Participation in _The Turing Way_ doesn’t only involve contributions to the Book.
```

Decisions and activities undertaken by Community Level members may include the following: 
* Making individual contributions such as creating an issue, fixing a bug, committing a change on existing chapters, and reviewing Pull Requests.
* Joining and inviting new individuals to community meetings such as Collaborations Cafe and Co-working sessions.
* Presenting about *The Turing Way* at an event.
* Initiating a conversation or pose a question in *The Turing Way* community channels.
* Suggesting content for _The Turing Way_ Newsletter.
* Applying to participate in the bi-annual Turing Way Book Dashes.
* Proposing an idea for training session or community events.
* Propose a new working group.
* Writing a new chapter.
* Establishing an informal collaboration.
* Other things that you can do as individuals.

We discuss specific roles under this level in a later section.

### 2. Maintainer Level

This level includes two types of members.  
    
* {ref}`_The Turing Way_ Working Groups<subprojects>`

Small groups of people that work together on a focus topic, theme, or type of work. Examples of *The Turing Way* working groups are: Translation and localisation (link to their Github welcome page), Infrastructure (link), Accessibility.

* {ref}`*The Turing Way* Delivery Team<fw-community-roles-delivery-team>`

Staff hired to take on responsibilities for delivering and maintaining work within *The Turing Way*, for example, Research Community Manager and Research Project Manager. 

Decisions that **Collective Choice or Maintainer Level** members make include the following: 
* Setting up, leading or representing a Working Group in different types of roles as leads, co-leads, secretary and contributing members. 
* Facilitating the creation of a new working group
* Decisions for planning and hosting the working group meetings and recurrence of the meetings.
* Organising and distributing the responsibilities within each working group.
* Proposing which conferences to participate in or apply to represent their work in _The Turing Way_
* Proposing which funding proposals or responding to a call for applications to support their work in _The Turing Way_
* Suggesting changes in ongoing processes or current working models through discussions
* Organising a [Fireside Chat](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/fireside-chat.html) by adding your topic idea in [The Turing Way Events & Conferences calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lWCWKAAXSlluo5d78LAjoMS9dfDxB27Y7Fb_wGI9B6Q/edit#gid=513475183). ---- a better idea would be to create form
* Clarifying unclear processes in that guide the work of a Working Group
* Escalating issues that can not be addressed at maintainer level

### 3. Constitutional-level

Strategic decisions and significant changes in the project, such as leadership, recruitment, goals, governance and funding.
As of 2024, the constitutional level decision making sits with the project leads, Kirstie Whitaker and Malvika Sharan.
Their aspiration is to move decision-making power to the community through process development through which more community representation, perspectives and inputs can be brought at this level.
Ideally, the chairs/representatives/leads of Working Groups will join this level in the near future.

In the future, this can be further 

- Providing leadership and strategic directions in the project.
- Applying for core funding, and approving expenses.
- Building clarity around budget and resource available for the maintainers and community members.
- Proposing new directions of the community
- Include a Advisory group
- Process whereby the co-chairs of the working gourps have an accountability meeting to represent their level 
- Leadership team would be Co-chairs and working group leads
- Each working group will have policy documentation in place to make decision, and payment options (if they apply)
- Advisory group could help in recommending funding options

## Community-Level Roles (detailed description)

The book-related roles vary based on people’s involvement in reviewing, editing or developing new content in _The Turing Way_ chapters, subchapters, impact stories, personal stories, case studies and templates
Reviewers are often drawn from the community, based on their experience in the chapter’s topic.
Often reviewers are also invited from beyond the community to ensure new members have the chance to collaborate based on their expertise.

* **Co-authors**: Co-authors collaborate on writing, editing, revising, or adding/replacing relevant sections of a chapter in _The Turing Way_ book, while following the {ref}`ch-style`.
* **Reviewer**: Reviewers critically review existing and new content of The Turing Way book, providing feedback, suggesting edits, and enhancing the accessibility, accuracy, and quality of the material.
* **Editors**: Editors oversee the overall coverage, coherence, and consistency of a chapter or a guide, or even the structure of _The Turing Way_ book at a meta level and document the current status and areas for improvement in a GitHub issue. They may not be the same people who address those issues, but they can be involved in coordinating contributions from authors and reviewers from the community.
* **Mentors**: Mentors guide less experienced contributors, offering advice and support to help them clarify concepts, unpack their thoughts and ideas, and provide direction to ensure that new members can effectively participate in the development of _The Turing Way_ book.
* **Advisory roles**: Individuals in advisory roles provide strategic guidance and expertise in the context of the book, community, or the overall project, helping to shape the direction and scope of _The Turing Way_.

### Mentored-Contributions

Existing members of the community are connected with new contributors for supporting and mentoring their contributions.
This mentored contributions are supported through offering help in navigate _The Turing Way_ repository, workflow, writing process or even reviewing. 
Contributions also include providing advisory support, such as by sharing examples, resources or other relevant resources that could be helpful for the authors.

By enabling our community of users and contributors to engage with each other, we ensure that the project, community and resources can be used, shared and improved by diverse perspectives.
We describe the contributing process in the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Beyond the Book

The book may be the visible product of the work we do in the project, but, the process of collaborative development with the help of its community is what we value the most.
This project can simply not exist without the collaborative nature of this project and the willingness of our community members to support each other.
We are committed to providing an open, accessible and inclusive space for all our community members where they are appreciated, upskilled and given opportunities to contribute to the project in a way that is most meaningful for them.

Roles beyond the book can involve, but are not limited to the following:

* **Reviewers and maintainers** of the book and underlying infrastructure
* **Advocate and champions **of _The Turing Way_ resources, who help others navigate the book, repositories and communications channel
* **Creators** of content and infrastructure at any level from fixing bugs to adding new content beyond the book
* **Mentors and consultants** in specific areas of work, including responding to questions from other community members on GitHub and Slack
* **Sustained contributors** who provide expert consultation to improve the resources
* Members providing support through** in-kind collaboration/partnership**
* **Connector, convener and collaborators** from the broader data science network
* **_The Turing Way_ curious** (‘lurkers’) users of resources who read, adopt and share best practices from _The Turing Way_ in their work and participate in public events/communications channel
* **Your personal experience** (that we value a lot!) will enrich _The Turing Way_ resources with real-world contexts

New contributors to _The Turing Way_ can begin their journey at any time, and through various pathways including voluntary participation, invited contribution, training/workshop-based introduction, organisational collaboration, and personal collaboration with other community members or others.
Our general recommendations for any new starters are the following:

* Start small! Find easy wins!
* Start with what they don’t know and want to learn.
* Start with what they know and want to share.
* Capture the process of how they work in their projects and _The Turing Way_
* They share their personal stories, case studies and perspective: _The Turing Way_ is a ‘lightly’ opinionated guide after all!

_To explore different pathways for community members to get involved, please visit the **Start Page: **_[https://the-turing-way.start.page/](https://the-turing-way.start.page/)_.

### Learn and Share Skills

Community members are provided with opportunities to learn new skills, share their ideas and collaborate with others. 
They are also given mentorship opportunities in the project as they make their contributions to _The Turing Way_ or other open source projects and are encouraged to mentor new participants of the project. 

Community members have been taking roles like trainers, workshop leads, translators, infrastructure maintenance, accessibility experts, representatives of different projects in _The Turing Way_ and advocates of different topics of _The Turing Way_'s interest in external projects.
Some of these areas of work have recently been formalised and are also being led by volunteer members (see Governance Roles).
For instance, _The Turing Way_ team and community members have been workshops from the very beginning.
Some of these workshops has become part of regular events and conferences to introduce _The Turing Way_ resources and data science practices among a new audience and early career researcher groups. 

Delivery of these workshops includes the following roles:

* **Expert facilitators and trainers** of Open Science, Reproducibility and ethics-related workshops, both organised by _The Turing Way_ and delivered in external events
* **Technical trainer** for novice learners on tools like GitHub, Binder, Jupyter and Literate Programming 
* **Presenters and speakers** for international events/conferences who represent _The Turing Way_ in external platforms

All members are supported to structure their work in _The Turing Way_ to make them findable and onboard new members in their work to provide continuity of their work.
Researchers are also supported to lead community-based discussions and collaborations, that lead to projects and outputs beyond _The Turing Way_.

### Establishing Partnership

_The Turing Way_ project also involves {ref}`collaborators<collaborators>` from projects within the Turing, partnering organisations, open-source communities, and beyond, either formally through funded grant proposals or informally through collaborative activities such as co-creation of resources (such as chapters, articles or community documentation) and events (such as Fireside Chat, Book Dash and external conference session).

### Representing _The Turing Way_

We have a chapter on {ref}`ch-presenting` to help you present and share about _The Turing Way_ in your network.

_The Turing Way_ team will be happy to discuss your ideas with you, provide feedback and any other assistance you need for delivering a talk.

_For further details on these community roles, please read the Community Handbook describing [different Contributions and their acknowledgements](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/acknowledgement/acknowledgement-examples.html)._
