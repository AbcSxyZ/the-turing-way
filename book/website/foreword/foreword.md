# Background

Everyone has a skill that is useful for someone, and therefore anyone can contribute to _The Turing Way_.

Long-term and sustained contributors of the project are considered part of the core contributors groups who take on various leadership roles in the project.
Please read  to learn about how we acknowledge your work and how our contributors are {ref}`highlighted in the project<ch-acknowledgement-record>`.

_The Turing Way_ is open for anyone to use, contribute to and share. 

Although _The Turing Way_ receives support and funding from [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), the project is designed to be a global collaboration.
We have contributions from across the UK, and from India, Mexico, Australia, USA, and many European countries.
Chapters have been written, reviewed and curated by members of research institutes and universities, government departments, and industry.
We are committed to creating a space where people with diverse expertise and lived experiences can share their knowledge with others to allow us all to use data science to improve the world.


Though most of these pathways have been mentioned in various chapters, we have also noticed that often it is hard for people to enter an ongoing project when they don't know what their role in the community would look like.

Since 2019, the project has grown into an international community of people with diverse backgrounds, research domains, expertise, knowledge and lived-experiences. 
Simultaneously, multiple pathways have evolved that interested members can take to engage in the project.

(fw-history)=
# History

The book started in January 2019 as a guide for reproducibility, covering {ref}`rr-vcs`, {ref}`rr-testing`, and {ref}`rr-ci`. However, technical skills are just one aspect of making data science research "open for all" and so in February 2020, _The Turing Way_ expanded into a series of guides: {ref}`rr`, {ref}`pd`, {ref}`cm`, {ref}`cl`, and {ref}`er`.


Start with a concept, tool or method that you need now, in your current work.

# Impact

_The Turing Way_ is an online handbook – and global community – dedicated to fostering gold-standard reproducible research. 
It’s a cultural movement with the potential to transform data science.

_The Turing Way_ is shared through its growing, global community of like-minded expert advocates. 
It shines a light on a broken publishing system that works against sharing and makes research less effective. It represents the Institute’s commitment to changing data science for the better.

We really appreciate any references that you make to _The Turing Way_ project in your work, and we hope it is useful.

## Impact Story

We provide an overview of the impact story featured by The Alan Turing Institute in 2020. 

Please read the full report online written by Sean O'Neil through an interview with the project lead, Kirstie Whitaker: [https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/impact-stories/changing-culture-data-science](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/impact-stories/changing-culture-data-science).

- There is a crisis of reproducibility  in science. 
- ‘Publish-or-perish’ incentives and excessive data secrecy stifles progress and wastes resources: siloed science is slow science. 
- _The Turing Way_ is an evolving online ‘handbook’ on how to conduct world-leading, reproducible research in academic data science and AI with the goal of making reproducible research “too easy not to do”.  
- The book deals not only with the ‘how’ of things, but also the ‘why’ – the ethos and long-term benefits of reproducible research.
- _The Turing Way_ is also a flourishing global community of research engineers, data librarians, industry professionals and research experts dedicated to capturing and sharing research best-practise, tools and data.  
- The team is collaborating on workshops with the people behind Binder, a key research platform that enables highly sharable research. 
- Through community contributions, the handbook will grow into a ‘How-To Guide for Data Science’ covering areas including research reproducibility, project design, communication, collaboration and ethics.

> “The reuse of other people’s data provides useful insights for new research questions and products, and drives new scientific discoveries." - Susanna-Assunta Sansone,  Associate Professor in Data Readiness at the University of Oxford and Co-lead of FAIR-Cookbook

# Our Community

The Online Book is the visible product of the work we do in the project, but, the process of collaborative development with the help of its community is what we value the most.
The backbone of this process lies in supporting its community by providing an open, accessible and inclusive space where they are appreciated, upskilled and given opportunities to contribute to the project in a way that is most meaningful for them.
In turn, these members support each other in the community, collaborate on mutually beneficial ideas and resources, co-develop chapters, review and improve existing materials, share them with the wider community, make new connections and develop a sense of belonging and shared-ownership in the project.

The book is collaboratively written and open from the start.
To make this project truly accessible and useful for everyone, we invite you to contribute your skills and bring your perspectives into this project.
To join this community, please read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and ways to [get in touch](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#get-in-touch).
More information about the community and the project is available in the {ref}`ch`.
We look forward to expanding and building _The Turing Way_ together.
