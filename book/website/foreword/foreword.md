# Foreword

_The Turing Way_ is open for anyone to use, contribute to and share. 
You can inspect our resources on [GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), contribute to the project as described in our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and re-use all materials ([see the License](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/LICENSE.md)).

Although _The Turing Way_ core team is located in London and receives support and funding from [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), the project is designed to be a global collaboration.
We have contributions from across the UK, and from India, Mexico, Australia, USA, and many European countries.
Chapters have been written, reviewed and curated by members of research institutes and universities, government departments, and industry.

The foreword section of _The Turing Way_ handbook provides the following information:

- {ref}`Vision and Mission of _The Turing Way_<fw-vision-mission>` 
- {ref}`Background and history<fw-background>`
- {ref}`Guidance on navigating the handbook and guides<fw-navigate>`
- {ref}`Our community and roles you can take<fw-community>`
- {ref}`Ways of working<fw-ways-of-working>`
- {ref}`Natable impacts of the project<fw-impact>`
- {ref}`Citing _The Turing Way_ resources<fw-cite-us>`

We are committed to creating a space where people with diverse expertise and lived experiences can share their knowledge with others, and help us use data science to improve the world.
