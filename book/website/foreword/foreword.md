# Foreword

This is an introductory section of The Turing Way as a project, a handbook, and a community.

Here you will find chapters providing contexts and background on the book, how you can use it, how you can contribute to different aspects of the project, and how you can participate in this community.

The project lead, Kirstie Whitaker (founder), discusses "Emergent Strategy" and how it has inspired her leadership and the foundation of _The Turing Way_.

Co-lead, Malvika Sharan, also shares her reflections from working with the community and how _The Turing Way_ applies approaches that underpin the "Principles of Digital Commons."

Finally, we provide details on community roles, citation process and frequently asked questions that we hope will help you answer your question and identify right places for you to get involved.

You will find these in the following chapters:

- {ref}`fw-background`
- {ref}`fw-navigating`
- {ref}`fw-emergent-strategy`
- {ref}`fw-embracing-digital-commons`
- {ref}`fw-community`
- {ref}`fw-governance`
- {ref}`fw-cite-us`
- {ref}`fw-faqs`
