# Foreword

This is an introductory section of The Turing Way as a project, a handbook, and a community.

Here you will find chapters providing context and background on the book, how you can use it, how you can contribute to different aspects of the project, and how you can participate in this community.

The project lead, Kirstie Whitaker (founder), discusses "Emergent Strategy" and how it has inspired her leadership and the foundation of The Turing Way. Co-lead, Malvika Sharan, shares her reflections on working with the community and how The Turing Way operationalizes approaches that underpin the "Principles of Digital Commons."

You will find these in the form of following chapters:

- {ref}`fw-background`
- {ref}`fw-navigating`
- {ref}`fw-community`
- {ref}`fw-community-roles`
- {ref}`fw-emergent-strategy`
