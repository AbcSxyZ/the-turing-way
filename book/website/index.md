‚ÑπÔ∏è **About the project**
^^^

_The Turing Way_ is:
* a handbook,
* a community,
* a global collaboration

Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers and data scientists in **academia, industry and the public sector** need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.

Please learn more about the project in the {ref}`fw` section.

## _The Turing Way_ Team and Community

_The Turing Way_ is developed, maintained and driven by our wonderful {ref}`community of contributors<contributors-record-highlights>`.

Hosted under the [Tools, Practices and Systems Research Programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems), _The Turing Way_ project receives support and funding from [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and is hosted under the [Tools, Practices and Systems programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) and co-led by **Drs. Kirstie Whitaker** and **Malvika Sharan**.
The project is coordinated by the community manager **Malvika Sharan**, who is a research associate at the Alan Turing Institute.

Together, we are dedicated to making collaborative, reusable and transparent research ‚Äútoo easy not to do‚Äù.
This means bringing together people with diverse perspectives, socio-technical skills and lived experiences to build something more significant than any individual could deliver alone.
