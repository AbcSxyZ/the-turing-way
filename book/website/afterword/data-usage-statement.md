# User Awareness Statement on Data Usage

We want to collect data on the reach and findability of _The Turing Way_ book, such that we can report on impact and also improve our book content to be accessible for a diverse and wide audience.

See our ongoing discussions around which insights could help improve the content quality [here](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/discussions/3713)

For this reason, we are currently tracking website traffic data through Google Analytics.
However, Google Analytics is problematic and so we are currently working towards adopting an open-source and GDPR-compliant analytics solution, such as Matomo for example.

In the meantime, we have taken several steps to configure Google Analytics to be as GDPR-compliant as possible:

- We have set data retention settings to the minimum duration possible (2 months).
- We have disabled all advertising features in Google Analytics
- We do not send user IDs to Google Analytics.
- We do not share any collected data with Google beyond what is required to "maintain and protect the Google Analytics service."

By implementing these measures, we hope to improve how our data is handled while we transition
