# TTW Book Data Usage

We want to collect data on the reach and findability of _The Turing Way_ book, such that we can report on impact and also improve our book content to be accessible for a diverse and wide audience.

See our ongoing discussions around which insights could help improve the content quality [on GitHub](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/discussions/3713)

## User Awareness Statement - Google Analytics
For this reason, we are currently tracking website traffic data through Google Analytics.
However, Google Analytics is [problematic](https://piwik.pro/blog/is-google-analytics-gdpr-compliant/) and so we are currently working towards adopting an open-source and GDPR-compliant analytics solution, such as Matomo for example.

In the meantime, we have taken several steps to configure Google Analytics to be as GDPR-compliant as possible:

- Our data retention settings are set to the minimum duration possible (2 months).
- All advertising features are disabled.
- We do not send user IDs to Google.
- We do not share any collected data with Google beyond what is required of us to ["maintain and protect the Google Analytics service."](https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/)
- (IP addresses are now anonymized per default)

By implementing these measures, we hope to somewhat mitigate the adverse effects of Google Analytics while we transition to a better tool.
