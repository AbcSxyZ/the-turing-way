# Working Groups, Funded Projects and Informal Initiatives

This page provides access to various group-based initiatives or subprojects, listed under three themes: working groups that guide the different areas of work as a formal part of Turing's governance, funded projects that are led by members in a paid capacity and informal initiatives that are led by members through collaboration around shared interests.
These subprojects are often time-bound and are supported by community members who take open leadership roles in response to the emergent and timely opportunities in the research and open science ecosystem.

### Pathways Python Package for Curated Access to Book Chapters

*Project Information: [GitHub repo in The Turing Way](https://github.com/the-turing-way/pathways) and [prototype repo in the Turing organisation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/bio-Turing-Way/).*

**Developers**
- In 2021-2022, funded by the Turing's AI for Science and Government (ASG), Research Engineering Group members, May Yong, Iain Stanson and Lydia France developed a Python Package in collaboration with Malvika Sharan. Named as Pathways, this package provides access to curated chapters in *The Turing Way* for different personas or user types.
- In 2023, a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Arya A. further enhanced the package to deploy specific features in *The Turing Way* book under the mentorship of Malvika Sharan and Johanna Bayer.

**Maintainers**
- [Arya A](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record#arya-a)
- [Johanna Bayer](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record#johanna-bayer)
- [Jim Madge](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record#jim-madge)

### Data Science Project Management for Project Leaders

*Project Information: [GitHub repo in the Turing organisation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience).*

**Developers**

- In 2021-2022, funded by AI for Science and Government (ASG), Malvika Sharan worked with the Turing's Research Engineering Group members Lydia France and Federico Nanni to develop two sets of training materials for mid-career to senior members of research projects in project leadership roles. Materials are hosted under The Carpentries incubator for lesson 1: [introduction to AI and Data Science](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects) and lesson 2: [open and reproducible practices](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/data-science-ai-senior-researchers) featuring *The Turing Way* resources.
- In 2023, through funding provided by the Turing's Health Research Programme, [Julien Colomb](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record#julien-colomb) from TU Berlin provided an in-kind support for the review of lesson 2 and its pilot delivery workshop conducted by Jo Havemamm from Access to Perspective.
