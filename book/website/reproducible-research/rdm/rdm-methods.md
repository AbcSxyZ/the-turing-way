# Methods and Protocols

This chapter will provide an overview of how to manage your methods or protocols and possibilities for sharing this work with others.

## Why

In order to ensure that others can reproducey our research, it is key that you document all the steps you took during the research process. In a wetlab, this is often done in a lab note book that can be kept on paper or digitally. In both cases the lab notes should record what you did or observed in the laboratory. It should be recording why steps were taken, including mistakes and thoughts or difficulties experienced during data collection and processing. You should take notes in a manner that somoene else, with a similar research background or yourself in six months, could use your notebook and repeat the work with the same results. It is very important to clearly describe every step taken and to be specific, otherwise reusers might misinterpret your documentation which will lead to challenges (as can be seen in this [exact instruction challenge video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct-lOOUqmyY)).

## Electronic Lab Notebooks

An Electronic Laboratory Notebook (commonly known as an ELN or a digital lab notebook) is a software system designed to help you document and maintain reproducibility of your research and share information more easily.

Electronic lab notebooks provide the following functionalities:

* A text editor with similar functions as a paper notebook
* A search function
* Secure storage and back up (especially in comparison to paper notebooks)
* Tools for working with tabular data (calculations and formatting of tables and graphs)
* Templates for documenting standard procedures
* Laboratory inventories for managing and documenting samples, reagents and apparatus
* Collaboration tools for sharing experimental information

ELNs can be software that is specifically build as an ELN, such as RSpace or you can combine workflows such as Atom and the Open Science Framework to take notes digitally.

## Open Methods/Protocols

[protocols.io]([url](https://www.protocols.io/)) is a repository for methods. You can watch two short introduction videos by [Emma Ganley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hva-oTapSWU&list=PL1CvC6Ez54KCcs99wV3eex1v5GUry6Yb7&index=12) and [Lenny Teytelman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wN6RqCmpqM&list=PL1CvC6Ez54KDvJbbdLn5rPvf1kInifEh9&index=13) to learn more. 

See Report detailed [methods & protocols - ReproducibiliTeach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzpY4A5G70s&list=PLWb8IFSVeQ620plPweZIQSGQODpGOww8r&index=3), at 23:33 there is a nice overview about the differences between protocol journals and protocol repositories.

You can also choose to [share your electronic lab notes openly](https://web.archive.org/web/20210309195308/https://www.lornecampbell.org/?p=179).
