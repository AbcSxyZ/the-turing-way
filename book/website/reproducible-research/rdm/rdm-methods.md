## Why
Lab notebooks:
Your lab notes are a record of what you did and what you observed in the laboratory. Your notebook should be like a diary where you record what you do and why. It can also include mistakes, thoughts, difficulties. You are taking good notes when someone else, with a similar background as yourself, could use your notebook and repeat your work with the same results. This also includes yourself in six months!
